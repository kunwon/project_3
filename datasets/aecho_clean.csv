amazonecho,BotDamian,Idea that would make the next Amazon Echo 5(?) amazing!,"Hello everyone,  
I have a Amazon Echo 4th Gen and I'm very happy with it and I love that ball!

I've came across a small issue that could be fixed and at the same time make Amazon Echo (5) much much better than some people might think.

About me, I'm a little PC nerd, Tech Enthusiast, Web Developer who works in the car industry in Germany.

Cons:  
**Amazon Echo requires a SmartPhone for setup**, older AND/OR not tech savy people might find the setup confusing and hard.

**Unable to delete Devices from Amazon Alex app**, for example I want to delete some devices I don't own, for example a Fire TV Stick or the Philips Hue light and setup everything again to be sure everything works. It took me 10min to find how to remove the Old Amazon Echo (the same I own) except I have it in setup mode and I was unable to find it again because it already exists in my devices? I don't know. Removing devices and groups should be 200x easier than it's now, I don't know how hight your IQ must be to know how to delete a Fire TV Stick from Alexa App, I'm not even sure if it is possible at this point.

Idea:  
Amazon Echo could have a built in SOC processor (ex. RockChip RK3399) for an Android OS, this would remove the need for a smartphone and make the Amazon Echo itself more useful, with Android come much cooler things, watching Netflix, Youtube and so on. Yes you could buy 20 Amazon devices and spend hours setting everything up or buying one device that works as a Smart TV.

Pros of my idea:  
The Echo has a amazing sound and it would also replace the need for a soundbar or a smart TV. I'm using now a mini PC (AsRock X300 + AMD 3200G) to watch movies and as a Development PC for my (Hobby-Work).",2021-04-18 13:14:33,1,"Idea that would make the next Amazon Echo 5(?) amazing! | Hello everyone,

amazonecho,thinksInCode,Best music streaming solution for family?,"I have several Alexa devices: two Sonos Ones, an Echo Dot, and an Echo Show. 

Currently for music we have an Apple Music family plan. 

Feature wise, it works well. We can stream different songs on different speakers simultaneously and it doesn't kick me out if I'm listening on my phone and, say, my wife plays a song on one of the speakers. 

However in practice it's an absolute mess. At least 50% of the time when we tell Alexa to play something, she responds with ""Playing specific songs/albums/whatever is only available with Amazon Music Unlimited."" We have to repeat the command several times - sometimes it works after a few tries, other times it never works. 

So I was thinking maybe it would be worth trying Spotify with our Alexa devices. However from what I understand you can only play Spotify on one device at a time? So if my son is listening to something and I'm at work and go to play something, it will switch to my work machine and stop on my son's speaker. 

I can't believe after all this time there's not (at least, that I can find) a generally accepted solution to this as it seems Spotify looks to be superior to Apple Music in several other ways.

amazonecho,ZarathustraTalkie,How to add scenes from secondary apps/skills to Alexa (Echo Dot)," Hi there,  
 

I recently purchased the 'Monster Neon Strip Light' as well as the  'Monster Prism', both of which use a specific Monster Smart Skill and  App to set colors for the lights. I can create scenes in this app, but have no idea how  to add them to an Alexa (Echo Dot) routine.  
 

So far, I've created a scene in the Monster Smart Home app and then  tried to ask Alexa to discover devices. Alexa never finds the scenes....  so I'm wondering what I'm doing wrong.

amazonecho,chaszzzbrown,"Named Timers recently stopped ringing more than twice, then the Timer automatically cancels itself.","Is there some settings change I accidentally made, or has Amazon altered the Timer programming?

For the past few years, if I set a timer by saying ""Alexa, set Egg Timer 2 minutes"", then when two minutes have elapsed, Alexa starts saying over and over ""Your Egg Timer is done"" while playing the sound, until I either say ""Alexa Cancel Egg Timer"" (or the like) or ""Alexa, add 2 minutes"" (or the like).

I like and have come to depend on this behavior when cooking.

But starting just the other day (say around 2021 April 8 or so), Alexa says ""Your Egg Timer is done"" once (or sometimes twice), and then stops without any input from me. If I then say ""Alexa, add 2 minutes"", Alexa says ""You have no active timers"".

Has something changed? Is there a setting I have accidentally set? Really makes the timer useless while cooking because if I'm away from the kitchen for even under a minute (say to dump the trash), when I get back one or more of my timer(s) may be done, but I have no way of knowing besides explicitly asking.

If this is the new behavior, well it's something I really depend on Alexa to do, so I'll probably just toss it and use Siri or the like.

amazonecho,randyth,"Inexpensive Button for Alexa Routines (""look ma, no hub!"")","I recently purchased a [Shelly Button 1](https://shop.shelly.cloud/shelly-button1-wifi-smart-home-automation#438) to check out. It's a smallish Wi-Fi button that costs around $20. It wasn't exactly easy to get working (setting it up was a bit time consuming), but it is a cost effective solution for people who want a physical button to trigger Alexa Routines now that Amazon has discontinued its Echo Button.

To get started, you need the Shelly Button 1 (duh), a mobile device with the Shelly Cloud app, the Shelly Cloud skill, and an Alexa, of course. Oh, and you need patience. The app takes forever to load the first time you launch it, and pairing the button with your local Wi-Fi requires you to switch your phone/tablet to temporarily connect to the button's hotspot where you then give it your router's Wi-Fi credentials. 

Once the button is added to your Wi-Fi network and the Shelly Cloud app, you use the app to create a ""scene"" that is triggered by the button; then ask your Alexa to discover your devices (be sure you enabled the Shell Cloud skill first). The scene should be discovered by Alexa as a ""doorbell"" device. You can then use this new doorbell device as a Routine trigger.

This is by no means a comprehensive set of instructions, but here are a few Shelly YouTube videos that might fill in some details:

amazonecho,liam913,Amazon Echo Dot 3 - Stuck on Blue Ring,"I plugged in my echo dot 3 for the first time in over a year today.

amazonecho,MindfulRelaxation,Echo Dot (3rd Gen) Timer Plays Wrong Sound?,"Just got a new Echo Dot 3rd gen and hit a snag with it. One intended use is for audible Timers (as opposed to Alarms) but have been unable to change from the default sound (which is called ***Simple Timer***). 

Configuring  sound settings in the Android app, I can pick a different default alarm sound which the app says will be “***applied to all alarms and timers on this device***”.

Then if I set an Alarm, I get whatever alarm sound I have selected, but if I set a Timer, I always get the default ***Simple Timer*** alarm sound instead.

By the way, my initial confusion was increased trying to work out what was going on until I realised that ""***Alexa, set an alarm for 30 seconds***"" actually sets a Timer, not an Alarm...

Anyone else seen the same Timer wrong sound issue - maybe figured out how to fix or workaround? 

My only workaround so far is to set alarms instead of timers, which is not so convenient for some timer uses... I did already speak to Amazon help (and will probably do so again) - so far they appear to have pushed a software update to the Echo but it didn't fix the problem so I thought it would be useful to check here first to see if anyone else has experienced this, especially with an Echo Dot 3rd gen.",2021-04-02 12:11:46,1,"Echo Dot (3rd Gen) Timer Plays Wrong Sound? | Just got a new Echo Dot 3rd gen and hit a snag with it.

amazonecho,vladoportos,Should you get Amazon Echo Show 8 ? ...probably not.,"So I have two Echo show 8, I got them for my wife so she can watch YouTube, online TV via web etc.. ( I do own also google home speakers that are hooked into my Home Assistant server ). This is my personal experience so keep that in mind.

The good:
 
- sounds is nice
- the web browser works ok ( with pop up keyboard, that's nice )
- mechanical cover for camera, I love that
- display is nice and bright
- netflix ( after firmware update )
- youtube app ( seems like the single app on whole device :D )
- can change wake up word ( If Google could steal this one feature I would be glad ) 

The bad:

- The whole QA and Function Design department should have been fired from amazon... Did they even test it before release ? This device have such a potential but total failure on functionality...

This is rant about what i wanted from it... While google can integrate with almost everything echo show 8 can do **one** music service ( if you lucky you get spotify, but its Geo locked so good luck if you are not in US... despite spotify working just fine on google, my phone and TV... )  Ok whatever i can listen to spotify on other devices...

So I want it display picture ( single ) of my choosing, or even multiple ... I would assume this function would get extra attention since almost everybody will use it. Despite having small troubles to get single picture on ( This is on my echo 8, my wife got set of pictures to rotate ) the display show the picture and clock, get dark, show the same picture again, get dark, show pic.. etc.. its rotating the single picture ! ( This eventually stops, but its super annoying ). As a ""premium"" you get to choose out of whole 3 pre-sets how fast the pictures will rotate ( Why the f. I could not set my own time delays is beyond me, my 25$ photo frame can do that... and why the setting is not located at the same place where you are choosing the pictures... aka ""Wallpaper &amp; Clock"" ) guess 10s, 6s and 2s are fine for everybody... speedy photos for the win.

Echo Show 8 will also get into blank screen, without clock, numerous time a day ( and this is my biggest issue, why I will most likely return it if not solved soon ), you can swipe down and press Home, it will do nothing... you have to swipe from right to left pick something like smart home or anything else, than switch back to home to get the normal home screen with picture and clock again... I have no idea why its happening and its happening on both Echo Show 8 I have.

Well maybe you would like to send some feedback... I tried that on echo show 8, there is a button for that no less. It will switch to home screen before you could finish second sentence :D I literally can't send feedback... I think it clever, you don't have to fix anything if users can't send feedback to you... you see 2000IQ play :D

Would I recommend Echo Show 8 ( and UP ).. not in current state, get cheep tablet, print stand for it and you get 100% more options and usage... or somebody talk to google to release Hub with working browser...",should you get amazon echo show 8 probably not | so i have two echo show 8 i got them for my wife so she can watch youtube online tv via web etc i do own also google home speaker that are hooked into my home assistant server this is my personal experience so keep that in mind the good sound is nice the web browser work ok with pop up keyboard thats nice mechanical cover for camera i love that display is nice and bright netflix after firmware update youtube app seems like the single app on whole device d can change wake up word if google could steal this one feature i would be glad the bad the whole qa and function design department should have been fired from amazon did they even test it before release this device have such a potential but total failure on functionality this is rant about what i wanted from it while google can integrate with almost everything echo show 8 can do one music service if you lucky you get spotify but it geo locked so good luck if you are not in u despite spotify working just fine on google my phone and tv ok whatever i can listen to spotify on other device so i want it display picture single of my choosing or even multiple i would assume this function would get extra attention since almost everybody will use it despite having small trouble to get single picture on this is on my echo 8 my wife got set of picture to rotate the display show the picture and clock get dark show the same picture again get dark show pic etc it rotating the single picture this eventually stop but it super annoying a a premium you get to choose out of whole 3 pre set how fast the picture will rotate why the f i could not set my own time delay is beyond me my 25 photo frame can do that and why the setting is not located at the same place where you are choosing the picture aka wallpaper amp clock guess 10 6 and 2 are fine for everybody speedy photo for the win echo show 8 will also get into blank screen without clock numerous time a day and this is my biggest issue why i will most likely return it if not solved soon you can swipe down and press home it will do nothing you have to swipe from right to left pick something like smart home or anything else than switch back to home to get the normal home screen with picture and clock again i have no idea why it happening and it happening on both echo show 8 i have well maybe you would like to send some feedback i tried that on echo show 8 there is a button for that no le it will switch to home screen before you could finish second sentence d i literally cant send feedback i think it clever you dont have to fix anything if user cant send feedback to you you see 2000iq play d alexa skill what skill no offense but 95 of these are a joke or not working for most people just browse and look at the comment there also doe not seems to be separation or group for skill supporting display such a wasted opportunity news another feature i wa looking forward to well thanks amazon for curating the news for me and not allowing to change them to something else like i dont know any other news source maybe from other country this is more technical issue though since the other news would have to prepare digest for echo so im not that mad about it but what about allowing r feed import and read that when i ask for news instead i have to go through flash briefing stupid name much easier is to say news and be lucky there is a skill from local news setting i dont have the will to continue just the setting is so minimal it not even funny would i recommend echo show 8 and up not in current state get cheep tablet print stand for it and you get 100 more option and usage or somebody talk to google to release hub with working browser,730

amazonecho,duffelbagninja,Help w/ Amazon Studio speaker pair.,"I have a pair of Amazon Echo Studio that are in a home theater group. I think I am missing something simple and it is driving me crazy.

Music will play from both speakers when I say “Alexa, play top 40” no issues.

amazonecho,yummy_crap_brick,Echo Show Lockdown?,"I have a relative that is mentally handicapped and is stuck in a group home since Covid hit.  I bought her an Echo Show and a cellular hotspot so she has a link to the outside world.  She successfully learned to use it to make calls watch shows/movies.  Sure, small screen, but at least it is hers.  

Recently, she's managed to do something to the point where she factory reset it.  Since she's several states away, this means it has to be mailed back so I can set it up again (nurses onsite aren't going to play tech support, can't blame them).  

Once I get it back, does anyone know of a way I can lock out the controls to prevent her from doing this again?  In the past, she's managed to put it in do-not-disturb mode and I think she turned off the wifi once.  Though we've told her many times, don't mess with the touch screen, the temptation is apparently too much so she picks it up to mess with it.  I can call her to take her through some very basic stuff, but trying to get her to put in my account password is not going to happen.  I've looked at the docs for parental controls, but I don't see anything about preventing anything like a device wipe/restore.  Honestly, I'd like to just disable the touchscreen but I doubt that's reasonable.  We got it because it's easy to use and she can just talk to it (also inexpensive--it's a group home, stuff goes missing).

amazonecho,BrownLucas123,Amazon Echo Studio,"The Echo Studio flaunts almost the same design as the previous Echo speakers. It is cylindrical in shape. The size is however larger than previous Echo and manages to throw a shade over the size of Apple Home Pod and Sonos One. The feature that sets the Echo Studio apart from not only most smart speakers but also most powered speakers in general is its support for 3D audio. Yes, the Echo Studio delivers on its claim of delivering 3D audio via tracks encoded in Sony’s 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos. 

The Echo Studio can also handle all the more conventional audio codecs you would expect, such as AAC, FLAC, MP3, Dolby Digital, Opus, Dolby Digital Plus etc while all of this is well taken care of by a Mediatek chipset that is integrated at its core. 

One of the very impressive features of the Amazon Echo Studio is that it is fitted with an onboard DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that can decode tracks with up to 24-bit resolution at sampling rates as high as 48kHz. The speaker has a dual-band Wi-Fi adapter and it also supports Bluetooth. The speakers are driven by Class D amplifiers delivering combines peak power of 330 watts via two two-inch side-mounted mid-range speakers, a two-inch upward firing midrange speaker, a 1-inch front facing tweeter, and a 5.25-inch downward-firing sealed woofer. The volume buttons sit up, along with the mic button and of course the Alexa-wake button with the signature blue-light ring present. As per claims, the Echo Studio delivers an impressive frequency range of 30Hz to 24kHz. 

The Echo Studio also has a built-in Zigbee smart home hub. It can directly control smart home devices equipped with Zigbee radios- including Philips Hue smart bulbs. Zigbee is a smart home protocol, and there are also a huge number of smart home products- especially smart light bulbs. The inclusion of the Smart Hub Controller means that it can connect to 1000s of smart home products, without much fuss.",2021-03-31 07:26:53,1,"Amazon Echo Studio | The Echo Studio flaunts almost the same design as the previous Echo speakers.

amazonecho,BestNarcissist,Echo Dot 4th gen remote mic solutions,"**TL;DR of specific ask at the bottom**

I have an Echo Dot (4th gen) in my bedroom, which I have paired with a dumb Bluetooth speaker in the adjoining bathroom. When I'm getting ready to shower, I'll tell the Dot to connect to the speaker and play Spotify/Pandora/whatever. This works well.

However, if for some reason I need to communicate with Alexa (volume too low, too high, switch songs/playlists/services), the noise of the shower and the separating wall mean I have to yell for the dot to register my voice. The potential solution that occurs to me is a remote mic in the bathroom. A dedicated Dot for the bathroom is my backup solution, but I like the idea of working through the issue instead of around it.

I can't figure out what the issue is past that or how I can fix it. I can't say how many months its been, but it's been at least since November I think,but still probably longer than that.  sometimes it makes a slight buzzing or distortion noise, but it's very faint.

I'm about to start public school again next week and I need  the alarm on my echo. Has anyone else had this issue and able to fix it themselves?

amazonecho,Steakmeat,Set timer to turn a smart plug off for a set period of time,"OK.  Here's what I want to do:

I feel like taking a nap.  Could be any time of the day.  What I want to do is tell Alexa:  ""Alexa, turn off my doorbell for an hour.""  Or half an hour, whatever.

My doorbell is on a smart plug.  And I can turn it off and on again -- if I remember.  But usually I don't remember, and then my doorbell is off unless and until I realize it's not working.

I can tell the AI to turn something *on* for a set period, using a ""sleep timer.""  Like, I can turn my coffee maker on and have it turn off after a period that I set.

But I can't figure out the opposite: turn something *off* for an *ad hoc* period at an *ad hoc* time.  A routine doesn't seem to do it, because a routine lacks the ability to accept *ad hoc* parameters when it's started.

It seems like such a basic function.  But then I gather it took Amazon forever to add the ability to control devices with a timer (rather than just telling me to do it myself!).

What has changed?  A week or two ago I took the Echo Dot in the kitchen, moved it to the bedroom, and made a stereo pair.  At that same time I brought an Echo Plus up from the basement where it was sitting 8' away from a Show 5, and made it the kitchen unit.

amazonecho,RidiculousBacklog,"""Playing on your Phone"" Notification constantly re-appears","So, I'm sure you're all familiar with the pulldown notification panel in Android. Anytime I am playing music on Spotify, or through the Alexa app (a radio station's custom skill, specifically) a large notification badge appears in the pulldown. I don't have a problem with that at all, it's useful most of the time.

However, Alexa has been continually re-displaying one specific version of this notification that simply will NOT stop appearing randomly. Doesn't matter *if* or *how* I dismiss the notification. I can force close the Alexa app entirely. I can go into the advanced notification settings and Disable Alexa notifications (which makes it disappear) - but it will randomly re-appear if I re-enable Alexa notifications. And obviously, I want to avoid simply turning ALL notifications off from the App.

The thing that's so frustrating is that *I am not even listening to the radio station.* It is not playing on my phone, or any other Echo device. Unless it is somehow running in the background without my realizing it? There was a routine to auto-start the radio in the morning at a specific time, but I disabled that routine too. The specific radio station has its own Alexa Skill, making it a bit more convenient to launch the station. I disabled that Skill as well!

Have power cycled the phone many times, cleared cache, etc. etc. etc.

But seemingly the only way to stop this ""Playing on your phone"" badge from appearing is either nuking ALL Alexa notifications, or removing the Alexa app from my phone entirely, I suppose. It's infuriating.

amazonecho,DuFuchs,Remove old (ghost) smart home devices permanently from alexa," Hi,

I have always had the problem that some old devices kept coming back to alexa after I have deleted them. I have tried many methods to remove those devices permanently. Deleted them in the app, deleted them one by one on the alexa website, removed all smarthome devices at once on the website, i also did a factory reset on all of my alexas in combination with deleting the devices on the website, but some of them kept coming back, causing problems because of duplicate names.

But finally I found a way that worked for me. It's not very comfortable but it works.

1. Turn off all you bridges/hue/homebridge/wemos whatever alexa usually discovers, this step makes everything a little bit easier because you will trigger the device discovery several times.  
 
2. Turn off all but one of your echos. Go to the alexa site and delete all devices one by one. It might be enough to remove the old/ghost ones but i was looking for a fresh start. After you have deleted the devices, start the device discovery and delete old devices that might be re-discovered again.  
 
3. Turn off this echo and repeat the procedure for all echos one by one. I was able to observe that **different echos discovered different old devices. And I am 99% sure that those wrong information survived at least one factory reset.** I guess by isolating the echos (powering off the others) the removal of the old devices information on this specific echo can be forced.
4. Turn on all echos and bridges and start the discovery process one last time.  

I am not sure if this is a common problem but maybe it will help someone out there. None of my old devices came back :)

My apologies if this is a known solution, I wasn't able to find it..

amazonecho,chapinscott32,Amazon devs are so out of touch with what people want. (A rant),"It took us this long to get skill support and custom commands? And they have to be dead last in a routine too? resulting in not using multiple at a time? Fine. So be it. I finally got a smart home setup I want. Here's the thing though. 

I finally get it all set up literally yesterday. They release an update, and now shits changed again. 

So I like subnautica, and if you know subnautica the cyclops has a sick voice. So I thought I'd use the MyPod skill to play cyclops voices after certain commands. As if I'm boarding the ship and what not. 

Again, I get it all set up and the voices are sick af and I'm loving life. I get home today and play my routine and before the echo plays the audio file it now says ""handing off to mypod"". PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NAME ONE PERSON THAT ASKED FOR THIS????? 

I'm SO sick of this shit they do. They'll put in time to make her fart the ABCs or a whatever but it takes 4 hardware generations to get skills to barely work in routines, and annoying voice lines you can't disable. I'm so sick of it. They are extremely out of touch with what the fucking POINT of smart home tech is. It's so frustrating. I hope I'm not the only one dissatisfied with the random bullshit they do.

I would want to do it without forcing her to change the account registered to her Dot.",considering purchase of dot for the family question to user | i am buying an alexa show 8 and a google nest hub and comparing them side by side in my home for a week one thing ive thought about my daughter already ha her own echo dot which she primarily us a an alarm clock and radio can i connect my show 8 to her dot so that i can broadcast to her i would want to do it without forcing her to change the account registered to her dot,91

amazonecho,yetiblue1,Privacy Prototype for Echo,"Hey! I'm designing a prototype for a class and was wondering if I could get some feedback for how useful you guys think would be.

**Essentially it's a case with always-listening capabilities that you put over the Echo/dot's microphones**

\- The main feature is that this doesn't have wifi features, so even though it's listening, it cannot transmit anywhere

\- You set a wake phrase like ""G'day Alexa"" or ""Good morning/Afternoon Alexa"" which will trigger a cover over the Echo/Dot's speaker to open. At which point you ask it normally like ""Alexa, what's the weather today?""

\- Once Alexa responds, the speaker cover automatically closes.

Respond with either sentences or adjectives about how you like/dislike this idea :)

amazonecho,Legend1138,Echo Show with FireTV Stick Usage.,"Going to post this here and FireTV forum to see your suggestions.

Currently I have an original echo linked to my FireTV 4K stick. One the main things I use my echo for is to turn on the TV, search for shows, open apps...etc. I am a fan of this function.

I am kicking around getting one of the new Echo Show 10s but knowing that, that device has access to all the video services I question how it will work if I have it linked to my FireTV.

So my main question is for those who have Show type echo linked to a FireTV how do voice commands work to control your TV.

I am thinking if you say things like 'Alexa, open Netflix, search for Ted Lasso, open Twitch' that the Show will default to opening up things on the show itself rather than the TV.

I am assuming that maybe I will have to add ....on the FireTV for all queries?

amazonecho,TheCogIsDead,My Echo dot revealed the creepiness of my temporary flatmate,"Hi guys,

I've been an Echo dot 2nd generation user since 2017. I'm mostly using it for controlling the lights and playing music on Spotify. Even though it's not a must-have for me due to the small dimensions it has I always take it with me when I move to another temporary place, such as our summer house. Even though my family members don't really speak English they got used to ""Alexa"". Neither they nor I don't have any concerns about whether Alexa listens to us as we don't speak in English. 

However, this time I've moved to a completely new country, Germany. I'm a student here and I took Alexa with me. As I was not sure how long I will stay in Germany, I rented a room for one month. I had 2 flatmates who were pretty nice to me. But something one of them did kind of creeped me out. One of them had some interest in hacking and web security.  

And our story begins here, it was a casual day that started pretty normal. I woke up, had my breakfast, and went out. After finishing a bunch of stuff I came back to my flat. I was tired and I told Alexa to turn the lights out. Then I got a reply saying that there was a problem with the connection. At first, I thought it might be normal as it happened before. 

Then, for the next 40 mins, I've tried to fix this problem.  I've tried to reset, disconnect even de-registration but nothing worked. Then, I wanted to test with my hotspot on my iPhone. And then realized okay there is something wrong with the internet here. Even till this point, I was not suspicious about anything. Then I thought about resetting the router but my flatmate was not home so I wanted to wait for him.

Okay, now the creepy part comes. As you might know Alexa records every command and you can listen to them from the application on your phone. The thing is I like listening to these recordings because even though they're short they're kind of a memory to me. So, I wanted to check these recordings because I wanted to be sure the old recordings were not deleted. Maybe, in a way listening to these recordings is creepy as well. And let me share what I saw in a time period I was not home;

\-Alexa, do you listen to me? (In German)

\-Alexa, do you have internet? (now he recognized it's in English)

\-Alexa, how is the weather like?

\-ALEXA, WHAT IS YOUR MAC ADRESS?

REALLY? I mean why would you do that, right? He literally asked Alexa to her mac address so he could block on the roster. Of course, Alexa did not tell him but this was what he's done at the end. This is how I figured out he blocked my echo's mac address on the router. Yes, this is creepy. A guy comes into my room when I'm not there and asking for mac address to block my echo dot. But, even though it's a creepy thing to do, I don't think his intention was bad. I mean he just can't trust Amazon. Sure, so many things he reads on the web, and I have some concerns about amazon listening to us as well. But, in general, I don't mind it. I wish he could just ask me to turn it off.

Finally, I've never talked to him about this but the day I discovered he blocked the mac address, I told him you know Alexa not working properly and I want to reset the router. He was kind of shocked, I think he did not think I'd figure out it had something to do with a router. And he said something might cause that but nothing manual. I did not even imply ""manual"". And then he started to ask if Alexa working properly. Because next day he unblocked it. So, thanks, Alexa.

amazonecho,lhymes,Very long time Echo user starting to have a pretty negative (and questionable) experience,"So I’ve been using Echo devices in our home since being selected for the original beta launch. Generally up until the past couple months I’ve always been rather happy with the devices and the experience, except for a couple issues related to involuntary third party apps being enabled and creating bad experiences. We currently have an Echo Plus, 2 3rd Gen Echos, a 2nd Gen Echo Show 10, 2 Echo Show 8s, 2 original Echo Shows, and a couple 3rd Gen Echo Spots.

Recently, things have started to get unsavory and, in one instance, really stunned me - I’ll save that for last.

Over the past couple months, I’ve noticed  all of our more recently purchased devices have suddenly started reacting very erratic with voice commands. It’s not one or two devices in particular, but almost all of them. Saying ‘Alexa’ even when standing next to the Show 10 will oftentimes trigger responses to a device across the house as if the spacial detection is off, but it makes no sense as the device reacting couldn’t have possibly heard you. Additionally, we’ve had a lot of false activations and pulling up the history usually presents “Audio was not intended for this device” or “audio could not be understood”, but the recordings have absolutely nothing to do with Alexa, nor is anything remotely close to it present, and sometimes there simply isn’t anything listed for review. In the past the false triggers were uncommon, but when they occurred, they were consistently presented in the app to review and generally made sense. I even had a situation this week where the device in my kitchen kept activating and I was repeatedly yelling “cancel” and the damn thing kept going. I ended up muting the mic for a day as it was so frustrating.

Now the worst instance, however, which has really weirded me out. I have a NAS on the network that has been problem-free for about 5 years. I recently decided to not only rely on iCloud to backup all of my pictures, but also use an app to sync all of my photos to the NAS over a WebDAV connection. Everything went well and my photos synced pretty seamlessly. Then, a day later, I get a notification that the connection dropped. I checked the connection and everything seemed AOK. I ended up power cycling the NAS to determine if it was a software issue on its end and I immediately find that the IP isn’t resolving to it. I check my network and another device has grabbed the IP. Weirder, however, the device is using my NAS’ host name, but it’s being recognized as an Amazon device, so I know it’s an Echo. After I check the MAC address, I identified it as one of my Echo Show 8s. Well, I power cycled the device and everything seemed to go back to normal. A couple hours later I notice that the NAS is having connectivity problems again and some services I’m running on it are performing unreliably. I immediately check the network again and the Show is once again spoofing the host name and competing for the IP. This was even with the NAS having a reserved assignment. Well, I unplugged the device and all was well again. When I reconnected it, it was once again using the hostname of my NAS, so I’ve since left it unplugged and have been trying to find time to reach out to Amazon about replacement. The whole situation has soured me, though. Obviously if the situation was nefarious, a lot more users would be catching this sort of activity, but I’m still not happy to see something like this arise, especially after so many years of things being fine, then suddenly things aren’t.

Well, I just wanted to share this experience because I wanted to see if I’m just super-unlucky or if anyone else has been having a similar experience recently.

I ended up power cycling the NAS to determine if it was a software issue on its end and I immediately find that the IP isn’t resolving to it. I check my network and another device has grabbed the IP. Weirder, however, the device is using my NAS’ host name, but it’s being recognized as an Amazon device, so I know it’s an Echo. After I check the MAC address, I identified it as one of my Echo Show 8s. Well, I power cycled the device and everything seemed to go back to normal. A couple hours later I notice that the NAS is having connectivity problems again and some services I’m running on it are performing unreliably. I immediately check the network again and the Show is once again spoofing the host name and competing for the IP. This was even with the NAS having a reserved assignment. Well, I unplugged the device and all was well again. When I reconnected it, it was once again using the hostname of my NAS, so I’ve since left it unplugged and have been trying to find time to reach out to Amazon about replacement. The whole situation has soured me, though. Obviously if the situation was nefarious, a lot more users would be catching this sort of activity, but I’m still not happy to see something like this arise, especially after so many years of things being fine, then suddenly things aren’t.

Well, I just wanted to share this experience because I wanted to see if I’m just super-unlucky or if anyone else has been having a similar experience recently. Edit: well I guess I’m just going to get ‘constructive’ down-votes thanks love ya guys.",very long time echo user starting to have a pretty negative and questionable experience | so i ve been using echo device in our home since being selected for the original beta launch generally up until the past couple month i ve always been rather happy with the device and the experience except for a couple issue related to involuntary third party apps being enabled and creating bad experience we currently have an echo plus 2 3rd gen echo a 2nd gen echo show 10 2 echo show 8 2 original echo show and a couple 3rd gen echo spot recently thing have started to get unsavory and in one instance really stunned me i ll save that for last over the past couple month i ve noticed all of our more recently purchased device have suddenly started reacting very erratic with voice command it s not one or two device in particular but almost all of them saying alexa even when standing next to the show 10 will oftentimes trigger response to a device across the house a if the spacial detection is off but it make no sense a the device reacting couldn t have possibly heard you additionally we ve had a lot of false activation and pulling up the history usually present audio wa not intended for this device or audio could not be understood but the recording have absolutely nothing to do with alexa nor is anything remotely close to it present and sometimes there simply isn t anything listed for review in the past the false trigger were uncommon but when they occurred they were consistently presented in the app to review and generally made sense i even had a situation this week where the device in my kitchen kept activating and i wa repeatedly yelling cancel and the damn thing kept going i ended up muting the mic for a day a it wa so frustrating now the worst instance however which ha really weirded me out i have a na on the network that ha been problem free for about 5 year i recently decided to not only rely on icloud to backup all of my picture but also use an app to sync all of my photo to the na over a webdav connection everything went well and my photo synced pretty seamlessly then a day later i get a notification that the connection dropped i checked the connection and everything seemed aok i ended up power cycling the na to determine if it wa a software issue on it end and i immediately find that the ip isn t resolving to it i check my network and another device ha grabbed the ip weirder however the device is using my na host name but it s being recognized a an amazon device so i know it s an echo after i check the mac address i identified it a one of my echo show 8 well i power cycled the device and everything seemed to go back to normal a couple hour later i notice that the na is having connectivity problem again and some service i m running on it are performing unreliably i immediately check the network again and the show is once again spoofing the host name and competing for the ip this wa even with the na having a reserved assignment well i unplugged the device and all wa well again when i reconnected it it wa once again using the hostname of my na so i ve since left it unplugged and have been trying to find time to reach out to amazon about replacement the whole situation ha soured me though obviously if the situation wa nefarious a lot more user would be catching this sort of activity but i m still not happy to see something like this arise especially after so many year of thing being fine then suddenly thing aren t well i just wanted to share this experience because i wanted to see if i m just super unlucky or if anyone else ha been having a similar experience recently edit well i guess i m just going to get constructive down vote thanks love ya guy,707

amazonecho,theJamesKPolk,"New Echo user, am I missing something? (Spotify streaming + devices in shared housing)","Hi all - new Echo user here. I'm considering a switch from HomePods to Echos mainly because of the lack of Spotify integration and expensiveness of HomePods. I recently got a few Echos but have been frustrated. I'm not sure if it's lack of functionality, user error, or a bug.

####Here's my setup

1.	Myself and my SO are members of an Amazon household (my SO has a Prime student account). We each have our own Amazon accounts
2.	We have a family Spotify plan - we each have our own Spotify accounts
3.	We have two Echos - we'll call them Echo1 and Echo2

####Here's what I'm trying to do
I have two basic use cases.

1.	I am listening to Spotify on my computer. I use Spotify Connect to transfer music to Echo1. This works fine. I would expect my SO to be able to do something similar with Echo2. From testing, my SO sees that both Echos are grayed out in the Spotify Connect window.	
2.	In the Alexa app, I have added all our smart devices (e.g. Hue bulbs). I would expect my SO, as a member of the same household, to see the devices that I configured. But they are not there. Is this expected behavior?
	

Regarding #1, my basic question is if I can have two different people streaming to two different Echo devices. I've read Spotify forums and Reddit a decent bit and I'm still unsure. My testing so far seems to confirm the hypothesis that this use case isn't possible.

I have a few HomePods and use HomeKit extensively. While Apple is a pretty closed ecosystem, I have to say that it works pretty well for Home functionality. I setup my Home, invite my SO, and boom - they can see all our devices, automations, etc. If I add a HomePod, my SO can access it and play their own music using their voice. We can have multiple streams going on different HomePods, each linked to our own Apple Music account. It works pretty flawlessly. Apple just lacks the algorithms and Spotify Connect functionality.

amazonecho,devilsyork,At my wits end with adding smart lights,"OK. I've got a smart light a couple of years ago, this has been connected fine and responds fine to alexa, ""turn dining room light on or off"". This light was connected via smart life app. 

Now, I just got 2 more smart lights today, and have connected them via the gosund app as per the instructions. I have named them Hall and sitting room in the gosund app. 

I have searched for new devices on the Alexa app on my phone and they have both been found and added with the names Hall and sitting room. Both these lights are responding to the alexa app.

When I say to my echo dot to turn on Hall, or turn on Hall light (and sitting room) she says did you mean dining room light? I say no, and she says she didn't find a device named Hall / sitting room. 

I have removed the devices from the app and have asked my echo dot to search for devices but she can't find any. 

If I go to alexa.amazon.com the 2 new lights are not showing on the devices list, I have tried to add new device but it doesn't show any.

amazonecho,cnquach,Amazon Echo 4th Gen - subpar experience using Spotify?,"Hi everyone,

Not sure if I've been using my Echo incorrectly or if the issue lies with Spotify/my iPhone/Amazon Echo... Just wanted to get a feel for if other people are experiencing the ""lack of polish"" that I am experiencing or if I'm just quite fussy. I've searched for this before but the Spotify forums are worse than useless! 

I recently bought 2 Amazon Echos and set them up as a stereo pair, when I play music (Spotify) through them I notice the following things:

* There is a delay of about 5 seconds between me pressing play on my phone to when the music plays through the speakers.
* There is a delay of about 5 seconds between tracks - this is especially painful when listening to albums where the songs are not meant to have any gaps during playback.
* If I listen to music for about 20 minutes or so, if I pause it via the Spotify lockscreen widget, it does not work. Usually when this happens, I will need to say ""Alexa, pause the music"" otherwise the songs will keep playing. (Also not sure if I'm being daft, but just saying ""Alexa, pause"" will confuse her and it doesn't understand that I want to pause the music).
   * Likewise if I open the Spotify App on my phone, it sometimes doesn't work, or the song will keep playing for a while before pausing.
* If I've very recently put on a song, if I change the volume on my phone, it works straight away, however if I've been listening for about 20 mins, changing the volume on my phone does nothing (both lockscreen widget and Spotify App).
* Probably the absolute worst thing about the Echo is that it seems that I can only use one Spotify account with them? My girlfriend also has Spotify, but it's a separate account to mine and even though she's connected to the same wifi network, it doesn't let her play music through her phone on the speaker. As far as I understand, it can only work with whatever Spotify account is logged in via the Alexa Skill? 

I had gotten rid of my Sonos Play 1 for these and I think I'm growing to regret that decision given I don't experience any of the above issues on it and that speaker was around 4 years old. i.e.: pressing pause on the phone would pause the music straight away and my girlfriend could play music through her Spotify as well. Admittedly they weren't perfect either as I would sometimes randomly not be able to connect my phone to them, but they worked far more often than the Amazon Echos. Is the difference here because the Sonos had AirPlay and the Echo doesn't? 

Does anyone else experience these problems or am I just being fussy and this is the wrong product for me?",2021-02-17 20:34:07,1,"Amazon Echo 4th Gen - subpar experience using Spotify? | Hi everyone,

amazonecho,OhLoongJonson,Anyone know about the security features on the show 10?," 

I'd like to know how the ""Alexa Guard"" feature works. I'm hoping it will go into security mode, where it circles or pans the room, and then if anyone enters, it will immediately focus on them and send a notification to you if you're not within the geotracking area, or if its not your face. Just the monitoring would be fine, though. I'll take a video of the burglar any day.

I like the alarm detection feature on this thing. Its supposed to detect glass breaking, smoke detectors, or any type of alarm and send you a notification. This is perfect because I have animals and If my smoke detectors go off while I'm at work, I'll know and I can get my mom over there in like 2 mins. I also have a Schlage encode deadbolt that has a forced entry and lock picking alarm, so it seems the inside of my house (I live in a single-wide with an open floor plan) would basically be covered if the 3rd Gen Echo Show 10 can actively monitor a 360 area and focus on any movement that isn't an animal.

When I play music and select the echo show from spotify I only see the current song, nothing else. I was expecting more functionality after going through all these steps.

I guess this is fine but I can't turn them off from the show 5. I don't want to go to my phone to manage alarms when I expected to do it from my clock.

amazonecho,kscarlett5683,Love the Routine update!,"I use the Alexa routines to remind my middle school child when her next period is. She had 2 separate schedules as a hybrid student (one during remote days, the other during hybrid days when it wasn’t her turn to attend in-person).

If the schedule shifted (like a 2hr delay), I had to change or create a whole new schedule. It was a nightmare!

A recent update allows you to create a routine and choose the days it applies to. Instead of 36 routines, I now only need 18! AND if the days shift, I can go in and just select/deselect the days as needed!

amazonecho,catchman84,spotify is not supported on this device,"Hello,

I have Premium spotify account (just verified that), Yamaha MusicCast BAR 400 soundbar (which officially is supported to work with spotify connect) and Amazon Echo Dot 3. I can not make Alexa playing the music from spotify on the soundbar tough.

My setup:

\* Spotify is the default music provider for alexa

\* Soundbar is set as default output device for echo dot

\* Soundbar have integration with spotify connect set up and working

\* I have both MusicCast skill enabled in alexa

\* I have the spotify skill enabled in alexa

\* I have latest firmware upgrade for soundbar and alexa (echo dot)

What I've tried:

\* disable/enable the spotify and all musiccast skills in Alexa app

\* restart the soundbar. Unplugg it from electricity for \~15 seconds

\* restart soundbar

\* restart echo dot

But nothing helped. Anytime i say 'alexa play song X by artist Y' then I get 'Spotify is not supported on this device'. I also tried to alter the request to 'alexa play xyz on spotify' or alexa play 'xyz on spotify on den'. Den is the name of my soundbar and other requests works (like 'alexa turn off the den' or 'alexa play xyz on amazon music on den')

Strangely, this is what is working without problems:

\* When I set echo dot as default speaker and I say 'Alexa play XYZ' then alexa plays that song from spotify on the echo dot speaker

\* when I play the song on spotify (i tried phone and linux client on my PC) I can see my soundbar in the 'Connect to a device' dialog and I can make the song play on the sounbar without an issue just by clicking on it.

\* If i change default music provider to amazon music (for which the soundbar has support too), then echo dot is able to play the song on the soundbar.

I have Premium spotify account (just verified that), Yamaha MusicCast BAR 400 soundbar (which officially is supported to work with spotify connect) and Amazon Echo Dot 3. I can not make Alexa playing the music from spotify on the soundbar tough.

My setup:

\* Spotify is the default music provider for alexa

\* Soundbar is set as default output device for echo dot

\* Soundbar have integration with spotify connect set up and working

\* I have both MusicCast skill enabled in alexa

\* I have the spotify skill enabled in alexa

\* I have latest firmware upgrade for soundbar and alexa (echo dot)

What I've tried:

\* disable/enable the spotify and all musiccast skills in Alexa app

\* restart the soundbar. Unplugg it from electricity for \~15 seconds

\* restart soundbar

\* restart echo dot

But nothing helped. Anytime i say 'alexa play song X by artist Y' then I get 'Spotify is not supported on this device'. I also tried to alter the request to 'alexa play xyz on spotify' or alexa play 'xyz on spotify on den'. Den is the name of my soundbar and other requests works (like 'alexa turn off the den' or 'alexa play xyz on amazon music on den')

amazonecho,Lowrider2107,"Amazon Home Theater: Echo as front, Echo dot as rear with Fire TV Stick","Hi all,

Google won't return answers to my question, therefore I'll give it a try here:

I'd like to use two Echo speakers to connect to my fire tv stick.  
I found that max. two speakers may be combined for this setup (plus sub woofer, but I won't go for that).

* an Echo (Stereo) in front with the TV
* an Echo dot (mono) in the rear.

Will that work?

Or will combing both somehow end up that the front speaker becomes a ""left"" channel mono and the rear a ""right"" channel mono? I of course do not want that.

Thanks for any helpful insight!

amazonecho,driven_under,Amazon Devices Acting As Access Points,"This has happened multiple times for me, and not just with Echo devices. My FireTV Stick and Echo Dots have recently begun appearing in my inSSIDer scans as access points. For example, last night in the 2.4GHz band, on channel 1, I found a new SSID called '**o - bedroom speaker - dot**'. It was broadcasting so powerfully that had higher dB than all other network devices on that channel in the 2.4GHz spectrum. Testing my throughput, both WiFi and LAN, I discovered that the best speed for download I could achieve was \~20Mb/s, when I normally get \~300Mb/s, indicating that my bandwidth was being almost entirely consumed. I went upstairs and rebooted the Dot, and the SSID vanished and did not come back. Internet speeds resumed their normal rates.

In the last couple of months, this has happened around 10 times, and the prime offender has been the FireTV Stick, so much so that I have taken to leaving it unplugged.

I know what you're going to ask....'is Sidewalk disabled?' and the answer is 100% yes. I disabled it immediately when the option became available and I check it regularly.

amazonecho,strikingeagle9,Tip - Organizing Your Echo Routines and Devices,"Hello all, I recently saw someone post about how they'd like routine folders for Alexa. This is a brilliant idea, but until that becomes reality (hopefully) I wanted to share how I kept my devices and routines organized. 

I started naming my routines by category first in all caps, so that they'll all group together alphabetically. This format is also easier to pick out when quickly scrolling. For example:

- ""VOL UP: Kitchen"" (Scheduled kitchen volume change)
- ""VOL DOWN: Kitchen (Scheduled kitchen volume down)
- ""ANN DOOR: Front""(Front door open announcement)
- ""ANN DOOR: Back"" (Back door open announcement)
- ""SHORTCUT: I'm Leaving"" (Any verbally activated action is labeled with Shortcut)
- ""BEDROOM: Sleep Music ""(Anything room specific organized as their room name)

For devices, I've begun naming them with the same format but all room specific:
- ""KITCHEN: Dot""
- ""KITCHEN: SHOW 5""
- ""BEDROOM: Dot
- ""BEDROOM: Light""
- ""LIVING ROOM: Lamp""

Something has changed regarding voice profiles and Alexa.  I’m looking for confirmation and guidance.   My wife and I have 1 Amazon account.   We got our 1st Alexa/Amazon Dot a few months ago. After I setup my voice profile I set up a voice profile for my wife.  Alexa would then recognize my voice or my wife’s.  Recently we noticed Alexa wasn’t addressing my wife by name any more.  
Checking the Alexa app on my iPad I see her voice profile has disappeared and a new instruction set is now present regarding an additional Amazon account is required??  Logging into Amazon with our Amazon app I can see her profile is there under our account.  It says her profile is available to Alexa...but of course it is not.
Has anyone else experienced this?  Has Amazon changed their policy/feature and I missed the transition plan?

* I like to listen to music/whatch videos. Therefore the speaker quality is pivotal
* I like to have displays so that i can quicky access to configurations and so on, additionally, i can watch something before going to sleep
* Basically i don't like how the echo show five sounds (it will go in the bathroom :D...mos def)
* I am concerned about the lack of the zigbee hub in the echo show 8 which is present in the amazon echo.

The echo show sounds really good with deep low frequencies and i currently use it to watch series and as a kitchen speaker for the music but the ocho sounds even better and has zigbee... i am kind of undecided between a second show 8 and an amazon echo for the bedroom.

amazonecho,Twinklingalphard,"Family messing with Alexa, how do I isolate her to my room specifically","So I got a free Dot last month and bought a smart light to use it. My family have been having a blast coming into my room to make weird requests on Alexa (ie: Alexa tell me the weather of (different country), alexa set alarm for 2:41am, alexa dim lights to 16 percent, etc) i didn't mind. Recently a friend sold me their Dot and I set it up for my parents because they needed an assistant for some things. The problem is that we live together and we use the same prime account.

amazonecho,gabiruman,Is the new Echo with Zigbee hub worth it?,"Asking for an honest opinion here... I've been dodging devices that require hubs to function, always preferring the WiFi alternatives, because I didn't have many devices in the first place, however I'm now moving out from my flat to a new house, and I'll be looking forward to expand my automations in the new home, and WiFi is not very scalable. 

I know people tend to prefer some hubs like smartthings and hubitat, but those are quite hard to acquire in my country and are also quite expensive, so I've been eyeing the 4th gen Echo with Zigbee, because it doesn't serve only as a hub but also as a decent smart speaker, and is cheaper of course. 
I've seen some opinions that the Echo is a little limited on the supported Zigbee devices, but I wonder if it's enough for the use I intend to give it.

I intend to use it with a few lights, 3 motion sensors at least, door /window sensors, and maybe one camera. For now, along with other WiFi devices I already own.

amazonecho,adamdprice,Connecting 2nd Generation Echo Show to Alexa App,"Sorry for the repeat, but the original thread that was on here was archived and didn't provide any help.  


I have a 2nd Generation Echo Show and I've been experimenting with the shopping list function.  Whenever I run out of something in the kitchen I just yell ""Alexa add \_\_\_\_\_ to my shopping list"" and it creates a shopping list for me.    


My problem is this.  How do I access that list outside of my Echo?  When I ask my Echo to export my shopping list, it tells me I need the Alexa App on my phone.  So I got the Alexa App for my phone and am trying to connect my Echo.  


In the ""Add a device"" part of the Alexa App on my phone it asks me to press the action button on my Echo to continue the setup process.  Not sure if you've noticed, but the Echo Show 2nd Generation does not have an action button.  I get to this point and am officially stuck as to how to get my Echo to share info with my phone.

Help?????",2021-01-30 20:22:35,1,"Connecting 2nd Generation Echo Show to Alexa App | Sorry for the repeat, but the original thread that was on here was archived and didn't provide any help.  


I have a 2nd Generation Echo Show and I've been experimenting with the shopping list function.  Whenever I run out of something in the kitchen I just yell ""Alexa add \_\_\_\_\_ to my shopping list"" and it creates a shopping list for me.    


My problem is this.  How do I access that list outside of my Echo?  When I ask my Echo to export my shopping list, it tells me I need the Alexa App on my phone.  So I got the Alexa App for my phone and am trying to connect my Echo.  


In the ""Add a device"" part of the Alexa App on my phone it asks me to press the action button on my Echo to continue the setup process.  Not sure if you've noticed, but the Echo Show 2nd Generation does not have an action button.  I get to this point and am officially stuck as to how to get my Echo to share info with my phone.

amazonecho,Twovaultss,Switching from echos to HomePods?,"I’m looking for opinions from people that have used *both.* 

We originally bought the HomePod when it came out, returned it after a few days of being unimpressed with its usability and functions and got a number of echo devices for different rooms. Genuinely good set up and able to hook up high grade speakers to a small echo dot and can put an echo in each room. But here’s the issue: Alexa is getting worse over the past year, Amazon is getting annoying with suggestions we can’t turn off, and she’s less and less responsive and we’ve had enough. 

Fast forward after our frustrations: I bought my parents a HomePod mini. Loved the sound for the size and Siri was more responsive than I remember on the original HomePod (I don’t use Siri on my iPhone) and I frequently play with it when I go over.

amazonecho,Tex75455,Echo Dot Group Question," 

Quick question for the reddit army (posting in a few places). I have 3 Echo Dots, one in the master bathroom, one in the kids bathroom and one in the living room. Let's imagine I start a 90s dance party in the living room, using a custom playlist on shuffle, which went on for a couple of hours.

Then comes kids bath time. Ideally i would like to send the in process playlist from my ""Living Room"" dot to the ""Kids Bathroom"" dot. I'd rather not restart the playlist, because then itll play a bunch of songs I already heard, so the hope is to just ""send"" it or something like that.

Is there any way to do that? I've tried different commands, but none seem to be working, and google isn't helping either.

amazonecho,deathboyuk,Recent (UK?) Alexa problems: possibly the reason,"Hey folks. I've spent the last few days trying to fix this.

Having spent some time trying to do a science on it, my results are:

The problems were that things that responded perfectly before now caused OTHER things to respond.

The common thing is: Anything that had a name near to another name, but ESPECIALLY anything with a name that included the room name.

The ""Bedroom fan"" was now triggered by almost anything with ""fan"" in the name.

The ""Lounge fan"" was, again, triggered wrongly.

They have changed their parsing, and it seems that room names now conflict with names you gave your items.

I had a ""bedroom heater"" and a ""big heater"". EVERY way I could ask for the ""bedroom heater"" to work, it now ALWAYS is parsed as the other device.

I have fixed MOST of my issues by renaming them until it does what I want.

Even while renaming, I found NEW conflicts as I tried out new names. I have a fan near my TV which was being ignored. I tried calling it the ""TV Fan"". Guess what? Now the TV would never respond. The ""TV Fan"" took all the commands.

Again, I changed it to the ""Floor fan"" and now the TV responded fine, the ""floor fan"" responded fine.

They've changed how they parse things, and it's not for the better.

I was told ""restart your Echo units. Then restart your network. Then restart all your devices. Then uninstall all your skills and devices and reinstall them all.""

I have 50+ devices. No.

So, if you're like me, you might have some renaming to do, but this is the root of the problem.

They have changed their parsing routines and you will need to change some names to make things respond correctly.

I now have my house full of items working fine again, by removing ""clashes"" that never clashed for the last 3 years.

amazonecho,DPAmes1,Funny Catch-22 when asking Google to trigger Alexa by voice,"The Home Assistant function to trigger Alexa routines has just broken due to a change by Amazon. It has already been repaired in a new release, but academic for me since I can't install that new release. So I thought as a temporary stopgap I might just revert to the old scheme of having my nearby Google Assistant speaker (Sonos) tell Alexa what to do by voice (yes, it's crude, but it works).  
But I found a weird problem right away - if I try having Google say a simple statement like ""Alexa, turn on the light"", the sound fades to inaudibility right after ""Alexa, turn on...(too faint to hear)"". I spend 15 minutes trying to diagnose what was causing that, before realizing what it was.  
My Google speaker in this case is my Sonos stereo pair, and in Alexa it's allocated to the same room group as the Echo Dot running Alexa. I've noticed before that if I say ""Alexa"" loudly enough to be heard over something playing on the Sonos speakers, they immediately quiet so that Alexa can hear me. That's smart of Alexa, that it knows to quiet the other speakers in the room group if they are playing. I suddenly realized that's what's causing my voice command to Alexa to fade out.  
Catch-22! I can't have my Sonos speakers say ""Alexa,,.."" without causing Alexa to silence them!

amazonecho,baxter300,Issue with Spotify playback - ignored requests and duplicated plays,"I’ve been having some issues with Spotify playback for the last 3 months or so, and Amazon support haven’t been able to help. 

My set up is two dots upstairs, dot and an echo plus upstairs. I have these in 3 groups: upstairs (2), downstairs (2), and everywhere (4). 

I’m having two issues which I imagine may be related. The first is with actually getting music to play in the first place. I will say to one of the devices for example “play Scar Tissue” and either state the group I wish it to play on, or leave that out if I just want it on in the room I’m in. I get the confirmation back “ok, playing Scar Tissue”, and then nothing. Try it again, nothing. Only way to get it to work is to ask it to “resume Spotify”. This is sporadic, I would say it happens 1/2 times a day but some days it can be every music request. 

The second issue, is that sometimes when the music has finished playing two of my devices will just play the song again. It’s always the same two devices (one upstairs, one down) depending on which group I played the song on if either of these devices are in the group I chose then those devices will repeat the song again. What’s worse is if I say “Alexa stop”, it doesn’t seem to think there is anything to even stop playing. Only way to get it to stop is to play another song and then stop that one. 

I’ve spoken to Amazon support and they/we have tried the following:

Checking for software updates. 
Replacing two of the dots. 
Deleting/recreating the groups. 
Deregistering all devices from my account and reregistering. 
Removing/reauthorising my Spotify. 
Room placement (I moved them all to within a few feet of my router and the same problem persisted). 

Does anyone have anything else they can suggest?

amazonecho,exitmeansexit,Echo studio audio dropout,"I bought the Echo Studio for my partner for Christmas to fill the gap of a better sounding Alexa plus a TV soundbar. And honestly it's just been a real disappointment.

At first I set it up in Home theater mode which wasn't ideal because some things we watch aren't on the Fire Stick plus we didn't like how it would turn the TV on when we just wanted to listen to Spotify. But besides that the latency was constantly changing creating some lip sync issues we could never iron out. Plus every so often audio would just cut out completely with no real indication of how to make it come back. 

But safe in the knowledge I'd ordered a toslink fibre I just ignored it. 

With the fibre installed I'm still getting problems. Watching a film it'll happily drop the audio 2 or 3 times and just sit there silently. Stopping and starting Netflix again, pause/play doesn't help. Sometimes it seems like disconnecting the fibre seems to bring it back to life but this could be a coincidence. Sometimes switching audio from digital out to TV speakers and back seems like it has brought it back. But equally none of these ""fixes"" seem reliable and for something that cost so much it's a pretty unenjoyable experience.

My googling for those with similar issues have mostly just turned up those who are relying on the home theater mode and pointing at WiFi issues. But I'm getting it on fibre too.

Is there any hope of getting this thing working properly? At the moment I'm so frustrated with it I've just disconnected it.",2021-01-26 12:31:59,1,"Echo studio audio dropout | I bought the Echo Studio for my partner for Christmas to fill the gap of a better sounding Alexa plus a TV soundbar.

amazonecho,Adeffender,Motion detected trigger stopped working,"Hey!

Suddenly my routines that turns on the lights when motion is detected stopped working.

I had router problems, so I messed with my router and network, and I think it stopped working since then. But in the end I arranged everything back like how it was in the start, all of my devices are connected to the same 2.4 Ghz network.

In the alexa app, I see ""Motion Detected"" when I check the sensor, so the signal gets to the app.  
Weirdly the ""No motion detected for X minutes"" routines still work.

I have tried the following:  
\- Disabling and reabling the skills  
\- Deleting the sensors from the alexa app  
\- Deleting the sensors from the Mi Home app  
\- Deleting the wall switches from the Smart Life app  
\- Deleting the gateway and the sensors from the Mi Home app  
\- Restarting my router/network  
\- Recreating the routines from scratch

Do any of you guys had this problem? Did you manage to fix it? I'm desperately trying to make this work again for 3 days now. :(

amazonecho,ILoveAndroids420,Can't change the volume on my Echo Plus 4 via voice command,"So just wat the title says. I can control it through the app, or if I ask Alexa to play something on Spotify, she still won't control the volume unless I go to Spotify itself or the Alexa app. This even happens with or without a Bluetooth connection also. I tried unplugging, but to me I think I will probably have to do a whole factory reset on her, but before I do that, do you guys have any tips? Even if it helps temporarily and I have to do what you suggested again, that's better than not having her change the volume. 

Both my app and Alexa is up to date according to Google Play Store and the Alexa app.   
Thanks!  


Bonus question (Dont have to answer, just dont wanna make multiple posts): Is there a way I can have two commands in a routine? I have a routine set for bedtime where alexa will turn off my LED Strips, and a voice command to turn off my computer, but I am unable to add another voice command due to the option being greyed out in the app, but becomes available when I remove the turn off computer command. I have gotten Teckin smart plugs, and got one connected and being used by my lamp. ""Turn off/on lamp"" works great, just wish I could add it to my routine.

Currently, when ""rain sounds"" is played in one bedroom, it causes the same app to be cancelled in a second bedroom. They can't be played simultaneously. It doesn't make sense to me as this did not happen at a previous residence.

They both work perfectly within the Alexa app and the smart life app, I can simultaneously change the color, brightness, and all that stuff IN the app. The trouble is that when I say Alexa “turn on/off the bedroom lights” it only does it for one of the two bulbs!!! Both bulbs are in a group in the Alexa app and the smart life app. I have tried everything I can think of (scouring google) and I cannot find a solution. Anyone have any ideas? I really want to be able to use Alexa to turn my lights on simultaneously instead of just one.",gosund smart bulb not working simultaneously with alexa | so i recently purchased gosund smart bulb a couple smart plug and a amazon echo dot 4th gen i m having extreme amount of trouble getting alexa to turn on my light simultaneously i have a light fixture that i screwed two bulb into they both work perfectly within the alexa app and the smart life app i can simultaneously change the color brightness and all that stuff in the app the trouble is that when i say alexa turn on off the bedroom light it only doe it for one of the two bulb both bulb are in a group in the alexa app and the smart life app i have tried everything i can think of scouring google and i cannot find a solution anyone have any idea i really want to be able to use alexa to turn my light on simultaneously instead of just one,158

amazonecho,samalex01,"Son's Echo is playing Beyonce, he didn't ask it to, and I'm hearing some other kid's voice on the Echo history asking to play it!!!","So my son said three times this afternoon his Echo started playing Beyonce.  He doesn't even know who she is...  so I went into the history of his Echo and sure enough there it is (image below).  Playing the recording is some kid's voice that's not my son, clearly says ""play me a song by beyonce"".  He has the Freetime enabled on his Echo, so I'm surprised this even played.  Needless to say he got completely freaked out and unplugged his Echo.

We have numerous Echos around the house, have for years, and we've never had this problem before.  I'm changing his Echo out for another one, but I'm just really perplexed how this happened.  Also just to say we have no other kids in the house, his bedroom is on the second floor, and there's literally zero chance some other kid could've said this and it's most definitely not my son's voice.

Anyone else seen this????  Thanks for any ideas or suggestions.

amazonecho,JDL-PhD,Best way to handle multiple users / Amazon accounts,"My wife and I just set up our first Amazon Echo devices and are trying to decide how best to configure it for multiple users. Specifically, it seems like there are some cases where it's better to have both users associated with the SAME Amazon account, but for other cases we each need to be linked to a DIFFERENT Amazon account. For example:

1. PODCASTS. We both listen to podcasts, sometimes the same ones, so we would like Alexa to recognize us as having different podcast accounts (e.g. through Apple Podcasts). For this purpose, it sounds like we need to be logged into **DIFFERENT** Amazon accounts... is that right?
2. SMART HOME DEVICES. We configured lightbulbs, etc. with my wife's account. Now, in order to view or access them, I have to be logged into the **SAME** account (either on the Alexa app or on our Echo). Can't access them from my Amazon account, even though we are part of the same Amazon Household. 
3. FLASH BRIEFINGS. It looks like you can only have one type of flash briefing for each Amazon account, even if there are multiple users on that account. So for this we need **DIFFERENT** Amazon accounts.

amazonecho,Ipse_Tase,"PSA: If your Echo stops responding or reboots, check your ad filter on router","...at least this seems to be the problem in my case.

I went nuts trying to figure out why my gen3 and 4 Echo Dots were crashing and stopping to respond to commands, no matter what I tried. At the same time, the Dot Gen2 is playing music 10-12hrs a day, NO problem.

After a lot of fiddling with settings, I decided to disable Diversion that is running on my Asus router (with Asus-Merlin) and see what happens...the idea was that Amazon added so much crap and ads in the last couple of years, that it might interfere with the attempt to actually BLOCK these intruding requests.

Lo and behold, albeit still in early testing, it DOES seem that bypassing Diversion (or any hosts list based ad filter) I can get the gen 3 and 4 to run stable for a whole day.

The price to pay? Now when I ask for weather I get the dreaded ""By the way""... which feeds me crappy ads despite the notifications for ""suggestion and products"" being disabled.

I ended up using the by-pass settings outlined here, for ALL 3 Dots:

amazonecho,Jadeldxb,White noise skill,"Hi, 

This has been asked before but I cant find a decent solution. I want a white noise skill that doesnt fade in and out  like they all seem to do and that isnt a subscription. I will not pay a sub for a white nose app, not going to happen, ever. It makes me angry just thinking about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the one post I found that sounded perfect was from a year ago from u/last_rise that said:

*"" I saw a number of people who had complained about white noise sound looping every hour unless you paid for the skill which often is an absurd $2/month for the popular skills. ""*

This sounds great I thought until I found that the skill is literally exactly what it says it was created to avoid. It costs an ""absurd $2 a month"" for the subscription that enables a 10 hour loop. It does say its 5 hours, but Im pretty sure thats not true, i tried it and it fades out well before that, I havent timed it but i dont think its even an hour. I could be wrong.

What I do now is just stream from my phone via bluetooth, but I want to use it for my baby and that doesnt work because when i go away from his room it cuts out, and when i walk back it does the annoying ""now playing from galaxy s7"" grrr.

amazonecho,KillerKingTR,Alexa/Echo Dot password,Its really infuriating that you can not set a password to your alexa. I stay with multiple people in my house as many Echo Dot users will do. I have 3 smart lights and ofcourse echo dot its self is a speaker. The fact that you cant use a password to protect these is really sad. People can just walk in to my room when I am not around and mess with it. Now I know you can put a password to the purchases. But if I am listening to music I dont want ot to be intrupped cuz they are playing music at home. Wouldn't it be really nice if they had a password protection controlled either by voice or from the app. You would have to unlocky the Echo Dot before giving it commands. Because at the end it is a personaly device. I think this feature needs to be intigrated ASAP. Also people use Alexas and Echo Devices to lock their front doors now albeit i dont know if those lock door devices have password protection with them but nontheless the Echo Dot and Alexa should have a protection too.

amazonecho,secfirstmd,The Amazon Echo Studio has unfixable faulty hardware and software problems leading to sound sync and dropping with Firestick or Firestick 4K,"Hi all, 

Frustrated Amazon Echo Studio purchasee here. Have had it since it came out and have spent days at this point trying to fix what I now firmly believe is a fundamental issue with the Amazon Echo Studio dropping sound at random points during its playback. No matter what app it is on. It frankly is infuriating and I cannot at this point recommend anyone purchase one unless you want the same problem.

There are dozens of threads on multiple boards and locations complaining about the same issue and Amazon has either given stock responses all of which do not solve the problem, at best they kick it down the road. It's a pity as when the Studio works it works well it is awesome but at some point it just too unreliable to not have the infuriating problem. Do not buy an Echo Studio and Firestick combination of you do not want the same problem.

Here are just some of the stages of stuff I have tried and NONE of them work to fully fix the problem.

1. Reset the stick completely
2. Reset the caches
3. Change from Dolby to Stereo (and to the new Low mode or whatever it is - which is annoying as that means losing capability I've paid for because Amazon's product is badly made)
4. Turn off lipsync
5. Buy a 4K to replace the Fire stick
6. Move wifi router right beside the Echo and 4K
7. Change wifi router so it's on non congested fixed channels that work best for Echo Studio and 4K on 5Ghz. Turn off wifi optimization. Ensure fast wifi - I have 250mb consistently.
8. Change Firestick to run on Ethernet 
9. Delete Home Cinema group and remove the Echo Studio from the app and re-setup them up (this only ever works to fix temporarily)
10. Exit the app you are in and open an Amazon Prime movie that you haven't opened before (for some reason this works as a temporary fix)

Trying to fix the Echo Studio/Firestick/4K issue has taken days at this stage over the course of months and cost me more in time then either products are actually worth. 

There are dozens of threads all over the internet about this problem.

amazonecho,Liddlewill,Camera integration,"Hey guys,

 Ive found a couple of threads on my problem but didnt want to hijack and mines slightly different so here goes.

 Recently a toe rag tried all the doors on my cars. Ring (doorbell and outside cam) spotted him and alerted me on the show 8. I bought a smart bulb and ive set it up so that the bulb comes on when motion is detected, then waits, and turns it back off. This is great.

 I would like to know if i can add to this, or create new routines to ""show"" the main camera on my 2 show devices (office and bedroom) , with the bedroom one only being between certain times if thats possible. Then switch off the cams after a short time to save battery.

 Ive tried, but cant figure how to roll them all into one routine, and ended up with lots of entries. Which has led to a flurry of ""motion detected"" shouts from 2 different cams and then an error message ""something went wrong""

 Sorry if this has been covered guys, all help appreciated

Husband has a face full of spaghetti sitting right next to me and I’m scrolling through shows to watch and all the sudden our living room light (controlled my Alexa) turns off. And then I hear the Alexa noise that it always makes after a command is finished. We looked at each other and didn’t think much of it. Just went about eating dinner. Well a couple hours pass and I remember that Alexa records voice commands. So I go on the app to listen to what it heard. And it’s clearly a British man (maybe Australian, but definitely an accent. We live in the US) say “Echo, turn the living room on” 
I freak. I start researching the hell out of it. Everything says to check devices that are logged in. Check decides on the Alexa. Checked devices on amazon app. I even went as far as to check everything logged into my WiFi router and found absolutely nothing that shouldn’t be there.  Another thing I find odd is I know that not many people call their Alexa’s by “echo”. The reason that we do in our home, is because my dogs name is Alaska and every time I said Alaska, the Alexa thought I was talking to her so I changed it to echo. Anyone have ANY idea what is going on here!?",2021-01-13 17:27:41,1,"Weird stuff happening with my echo. | Hi all. I was wondering if maybe someone can help me figure this out.

amazonecho,ptmcc47,My echo morning routine involves playing the “latest” podcast. However the current day’s podcast doesn’t seem to load until at least 7am,"New Echo user. I usually wake up at 6am on weekdays, except for one day where I sleep in until 7. If I ask Alexa to play “the latest” podcast episode of NY Times The Daily when I wake up, I end up with the previous day’s episode, except for the day when I wake up at 7am, which correctly plays that day’s episode. 

I am unsure why this happens. I am in the pacific time zone, so theoretically these episodes should have long been updated by the time I wake at 6am. I have tried setting alarms, routines, or just directly asking Alexa to play the latest outright, and I’ve found that if it’s at 6am (or around then) I invariably get the previous day’s episode. 

Does anyone else experience this issue? I use Apple Music as my default music/podcast source and so I thought that perhaps since I use a third party service, perhaps Amazon has some kind of limitation to delay refreshes on these services. Additionally, I have experienced this problem when Alexa gets the podcast through iHeartRadio. 

Any help/insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",2021-01-13 14:44:30,1,"My echo morning routine involves playing the “latest” podcast.

amazonecho,OhMy_No,"""No new devices found."" no matter what I do...","Hi all, hoping someone here with some better technical knowledge than I do has some better suggestions than customer support's suggestions of signing out, back in, and rebooting devices.  
I have some Amazon Cloud Cams and Philips Hue bulbs that are already connected without issue. I *had* a Nest thermostat that was connected, but after some issues after Google's takeover, they wanted me to factory reset the device, and ever since, I have been unable to add it back to my Alexa echo system. This has been going on for a while (at least 2 years now), and I've just sort of accepted it won't work anymore. However, I just picked up [a new TV](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B085LR4NPN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) today that works with Alexa. Running into the same issue here.  

The TV has a built-in Alexa service, and gave step-by-step instructions on how to connect, which involved the following steps:

1. Go to my.vidaa.com/alexa and create an account
2. Pair with TV using generated code
3. Once paired, go into Alexa app
4. Enable 'Hisense Smart TV' skill (account linking required)
5. Link account in skill
6. It automatically searches for devices afterward

And at this point, it fails (searches for 45 seconds, returns ""No new devices found."") I spent an hour talking to support and trying all sorts of different things, including downloading a different app on my phone, [RemoteNOW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.universal.remote.ms&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US), and otherwise doing the same process (the only difference is steps 1 and 2 occur within the RemoteNOW app and it didn't have me use any sort of account). I couldn't even find anywhere in the app to use an account. But it was able to pair to my TV, and I was able to control my TV from the app just fine. Go back into Alexa, and enable the Hisense Smart TV skill again, and it fails again with the same message.

[Here's the documentation](https://www.hisense-usa.com/amazon-alexa-support-info) the Alexa support referenced, but the instructions weren't exact, so I wasn't able to follow them to the letter.  

As info - I am an IT admin that's been in the business for over 15 years. I also like to follow tech (mobile, IoT, autonomy, machine/deep learning, etc.) and tinker with it as a bit of a hobby. I built a managed network for my home, with a virtualized pfSense box for my firewall, XPenology virtualized NAS, an EdgeRouter-X as an internal router with a UniFi AP providing Wi-Fi throughout my house. My wireless subnet is different than my wired network, but I currently have the ability to talk between the two.  

I am assuming there is some sort of network issue, but I can't figure out what. My wireless traffic has no trouble getting to the internet, and it can access my NAS (outside of the internal router) just fine. The TV runs on Android TV, and utilizing Google's ecosystem, I can connect no problem (used an app to transfer a file explorer from my tablet to the TV as well as screencasting to it without issue). Just for the sake of verifying, I can also ping between wireless devices (including to my TV) without issue.  
I went into the ER-X and checked the firewall rules, and there were 3 that were set to drop traffic. I disabled these to test, but still no luck.  

Anyone have any ideas where else to look? I'm not able to bypass the ER-X as it is providing PoE power to the UniFi AP, (and I would like to have an additional layer of security for IoT/Wi-Fi anyway) so unfortunately, that is out for the moment. Not that I imagine that would change anything, as my Hue Bridge is behind the ER-X and paired just fine.

amazonecho,Finnzz,"1 Echo Studio is Nice, 2 is worse?","So I bought an Echo Studio with the primary intent of using it as a soundbar.  As a soundbar the little unit did a really good job.  I saw a few people talking about how 2 Studios is even better, so after a month of use I bought a second one to use as an Echo pair in Alexa's Home Theater setup.

For a couple movies having the spacial separation of left and right speakers was nice, most recently I'm thinking Pixar's Soul.  This movie had a Dolby Digital Plus audio track, and for multichannel sources, I'm still trying to decide if two Studios are better.

The noticeable downside of a Studio pair is when playing content that only has a stereo audio track.  The Studio has 3 speakers (left, right, upward) and a tweeter that points directly ahead to the viewer (and downward firing sub).  With a stereo audio source, the Studio only uses the outward and upward firing speakers (left speaker on the left studio, right speaker on the right studio).  And the inner speakers and tweeters are silent!.  But the tweeter is where you want the vocals/dialog to come from!  And the fact that the outward firing speakers with the vocals is pointed 90degrees from the viewer I think makes hearing dialog harder/less clear.

I guess I'm just not convinced that the pairing mode is really optimized to take full advantage of the Studio speaker set.  And I think depending on the content, the experience is either similar to one Studio alone or worse.

I am talking specifically about video content, not music listening.  

What are your impressions of a Studio vs Studio pair for watching TV/movies?",2021-01-12 10:57:02,1,"1 Echo Studio is Nice, 2 is worse? | So I bought an Echo Studio with the primary intent of using it as a soundbar.

amazonecho,Human_no_4815162342,Should I buy an Echo Dot to control Tradfri lightbulbs(Zigbee)?," Hi,  I have just got a set of IKEA tradfri bulbs with the IKEA gateway and 2 remotes.  It's working great and I like the ability to change intensity and  temperature but the automation possible through the gateway and the app  is not enough. I wasn't expecting it to be but I didn't want to go all  in wihout trying the bulbs first so now I am considering buying a smart  speaker/zigbee hub and some more switches.

I am specifically looking at the **Amazon Echo Dot 4** and the **Google Nest Mini**.

I  want to have a morning routine on a timer that gradually turns up the  intensity and temperature and plays music randomly from a playlist  (basically an artificially enhanced and delayed sunrise with an alarm).  Plus a routine that lowers intensity and temperature after a set hour  but only if the lights are already turned on (and if they are turned on  afterwards the routine should be triggered anyway). Voice commands to switch presets and support for third party programmable switches are  welcomed bonuses.

Can the Echo Dot 4 achieve this?

I  can write a few lines of code if it's the only way (and it's well  documented) but I have no experience with Alexa or home automation (and no home  server yet) so for the time being I would appreciate something ready out  of the box or that requires minimal tweaking.

amazonecho,KaraStarbuck,Some questions from a newb about setting up echoes in my house,"OKay, brief backstory,  I broke my ankle in November very badly and was in the hospital for a month doing acute physical therapy.  While there, my roommate told me she was going out of town for a month so I would be home alone in the house when I got discharged.  I then thought it would be nice to be able to turn the lights off and on by voice so I ordered a gen 4 echo dot with clock.

I set it up when I got home two weeks ago and got a smart bulb for my lamp.  Okay, works well.  Then I saw the echo flex on sale for $10 and ordered a couple thinking both I'd like to control the lights in other rooms and in case I fell, it would be a way to call for help if I don't have my phone.  I currently have a flex in my bathroom and living room.

So I have some questions and please forgive me, I know I should figure this stuff out myself but I'm still on good pain killers which makes me a bit foggy.

1.  My echo dot seems to have issues about once a day.  Usually in the morningish time.  Alexa will either say it can't connect to the internet and I should reboot my router or it is having trouble understanding.  At first I rebooted the router every time and that worked.  Once I had the flexes I noted the dot would say it couldn't connect to the internet but the flex in the bathroom was online with no problem.  So I started unplugging the power cord on the dot and plugging it back in which fixes it every time.  I'm just wondering what could be causing this and if something is set up wrong or it is some hardware issues.  I do have a router that has both a 5ghz network and a 2.4ghz network set up.  Alexa and all the smart bulbs I have gotten are set up to connect to the former.  But could the existence of the latter be messing something?  I am not sure where my router documentation is but I was going to try and just take down the 5ghz network this weekend.
2. My roommate is coming back next week.  I ordered an echo dot for her.  I figure I'm being both helpful and self serving since I'm sure she could get good use from it but I like the idea of being able to use it as in intercom.  I understand there are security concerns about the drop in feature and I'm going to discuss this with her in depth so we are clear on how it works and what is and isn't okay.  I know she would be able to disable the mic and I think she could turn off drop in the app if she felt like being alone,  Does drop in only work in one room?
3. The second dot I ordered for roomie is being delivered today.  I noticed it shows up in my alexa app already.  Now if we set it up in her room like that she would have access to all my linked linked apps/accounts and get my notifications, right?  I think there is a Household feature that would work here?  I just want her dot to be on her own amazon account but she can still control all the lights I set up in the common areas of the house.  I ordered smart light switches which our landlord is installing so there will be a bunch.  I think I need to deauthorize the echo and then she can set it up.  Do I need to set up the household thing first?
4. I really wanted to use the dot as an alarm clock which isn't going so well.  The alarm is so quiet.  I tried pushing the plus button on the dot to increase it and that didn't help.  Then I tried raising the alarm sound setting in the app as high as it would go.  Again no change.  So what do I do to get an alarm that would actually wake me up?  Is this a sign of a hardware issue or just something set wrong.  Also, assuming I ever fix this problem can my echo dot play it loudly while the echoes in the house not?  I don't want to wake up my roommate.
5.  I noticed the flexes would only let me choose between about 4 or 5 names to call alexa. Alexa, echo, computer or something else.  Is there a work around for this?  I think it would get confusing trying to keep them straight.

SOrry, this is so long.

4. I really wanted to use the dot as an alarm clock which isn't going so well.  The alarm is so quiet.  I tried pushing the plus button on the dot to increase it and that didn't help.  Then I tried raising the alarm sound setting in the app as high as it would go.  Again no change.  So what do I do to get an alarm that would actually wake me up?  Is this a sign of a hardware issue or just something set wrong.  Also, assuming I ever fix this problem can my echo dot play it loudly while the echoes in the house not?  I don't want to wake up my roommate.
5.  I noticed the flexes would only let me choose between about 4 or 5 names to call alexa. Alexa, echo, computer or something else.  Is there a work around for this?  I think it would get confusing trying to keep them straight.

SOrry, this is so long.  Thanks in advance.",some question from a newb about setting up echo in my house | okay brief backstory i broke my ankle in november very badly and wa in the hospital for a month doing acute physical therapy while there my roommate told me she wa going out of town for a month so i would be home alone in the house when i got discharged i then thought it would be nice to be able to turn the light off and on by voice so i ordered a gen 4 echo dot with clock i set it up when i got home two week ago and got a smart bulb for my lamp okay work well then i saw the echo flex on sale for 10 and ordered a couple thinking both id like to control the light in other room and in case i fell it would be a way to call for help if i dont have my phone i currently have a flex in my bathroom and living room so i have some question and please forgive me i know i should figure this stuff out myself but im still on good pain killer which make me a bit foggy 1 my echo dot seems to have issue about once a day usually in the morningish time alexa will either say it cant connect to the internet and i should reboot my router or it is having trouble understanding at first i rebooted the router every time and that worked once i had the flex i noted the dot would say it couldnt connect to the internet but the flex in the bathroom wa online with no problem so i started unplugging the power cord on the dot and plugging it back in which fix it every time im just wondering what could be causing this and if something is set up wrong or it is some hardware issue i do have a router that ha both a 5ghz network and a 2 4ghz network set up alexa and all the smart bulb i have gotten are set up to connect to the former but could the existence of the latter be messing something i am not sure where my router documentation is but i wa going to try and just take down the 5ghz network this weekend 2 my roommate is coming back next week i ordered an echo dot for her i figure im being both helpful and self serving since im sure she could get good use from it but i like the idea of being able to use it a in intercom i understand there are security concern about the drop in feature and im going to discus this with her in depth so we are clear on how it work and what is and isnt okay i know she would be able to disable the mic and i think she could turn off drop in the app if she felt like being alone doe drop in only work in one room 3 the second dot i ordered for roomie is being delivered today i noticed it show up in my alexa app already now if we set it up in her room like that she would have access to all my linked linked apps account and get my notification right i think there is a household feature that would work here i just want her dot to be on her own amazon account but she can still control all the light i set up in the common area of the house i ordered smart light switch which our landlord is installing so there will be a bunch i think i need to deauthorize the echo and then she can set it up do i need to set up the household thing first 4 i really wanted to use the dot a an alarm clock which isnt going so well the alarm is so quiet i tried pushing the plus button on the dot to increase it and that didnt help then i tried raising the alarm sound setting in the app a high a it would go again no change so what do i do to get an alarm that would actually wake me up is this a sign of a hardware issue or just something set wrong also assuming i ever fix this problem can my echo dot play it loudly while the echo in the house not i dont want to wake up my roommate 5 i noticed the flex would only let me choose between about 4 or 5 name to call alexa alexa echo computer or something else is there a work around for this i think it would get confusing trying to keep them straight sorry this is so long thanks in advance,805
amazonecho,semiconodon,Two words for perfect sleep,"The routines for playing sounds appear to have their wings clipped, starting with weekly lectures about buying upgrades. It’s also especially annoying if you want to use a popular skill and have it stop after so many minutes. The syntax rules don’t allow shutting off to be the last item, I guess for various nefarious reasons.

Here is the perfect routine for doing what Alexa should have kept on doing:
1) Find on Spotify some looooong songs with the sound you want. I searched for “wave sound one hour”.  The point here is you don’t want to listen to an album of 30, two-minute clips of varying volume and content if you’re using it to get to sleep.
2) Name a playlist with one or more of these songs, such as “my ocean”.

The last few days my alexa has been telling me it cannot find my nest thermostat (gen 3) It has been working the last 8 months without a hitch since I set it up. Even during power outages, wifi going down etc, it always connects again.

Now it just doesn't work anymore. After research, I did everything I think possible. Reset wifi first, a few times and kept trying. Next I disabled and re enabled the alexa nest skill. Didn't work. Went into Google account, removed any alexa permissions, disabled the skill again and started completely from scratch.

I connect alexa and Google together just fine, give it all the permissions it wants. But when i go to discover devices, it just doesn't find the nest anymore..

I can control the Nest thermostat just fine from my Nest app, shows online fine. As good measure, I even reset my nest wifi directly on the thermostat itself. Reentered the password, online no problem, works with next app good.

What else can I do!? Only the last few days this has started. Nothing at all has changed, was working for many months since I bought the nest brand new, and now these issues.

amazonecho,Gobtholemew,Bluetooth Speaker Media Buttons to Control Alexa Music?,"Hoping someone here can help...

So I used to have a first generation Echo Dot in my bathroom, with a waterproof BlueTooth Speaker in the shower. The speaker has some buttons on it, including Next Track and Previous Track, Answer, Hang Up, etc. I used the Next and Previous buttons a lot with Amazon Music as they would skip tracks.

Fast forward a few years and it came time to upgrade the Echo Dot in the bathroom to an old first generation full size Echo (the one where you can rotate the top to adjust the volume). So I removed the BlueTooth Speaker pairing in the Alexa App, told my speaker to factory reset, and repaired it with the ""new"" Amazon Echo, and it mostly works fine.

However, there are two difference. First, the Echo pairs with the speaker within a couple of seconds of me switching the speaker on. That's actually good, just different and maybe relevant. With my old Echo Dot I always had verbally to tell it to pair.

The second difference, and this is the annoying one, is that those media buttons don't work. I can't skip tracks using the buttons, and unfortunately the Echo rarely hears me through the shower cubicle and over the noise of the water and the music.

I've tried unpairing and repairing and factory resetting the speakers a hundred times.

I suspect that originally the Echo Dot thought the BlueTooth Speaker was a hands free kit (by virtue of the fact it has hang up and call buttons on it specifically for that purpose), but that's a guess.

Any ideas how I can get the Echo to pair with my BlueTooth Speaker in a way that allows it to use the media buttons, just like it did with the Echo Dot?",2021-01-07 18:49:19,1,"Bluetooth Speaker Media Buttons to Control Alexa Music? | Hoping someone here can help...

However, there are two difference. First, the Echo pairs with the speaker within a couple of seconds of me switching the speaker on. That's actually good, just different and maybe relevant. With my old Echo Dot I always had verbally to tell it to pair.

The second difference, and this is the annoying one, is that those media buttons don't work. I can't skip tracks using the buttons, and unfortunately the Echo rarely hears me through the shower cubicle and over the noise of the water and the music.

I've tried unpairing and repairing and factory resetting the speakers a hundred times.

I suspect that originally the Echo Dot thought the BlueTooth Speaker was a hands free kit (by virtue of the fact it has hang up and call buttons on it specifically for that purpose), but that's a guess.

Any ideas how I can get the Echo to pair with my BlueTooth Speaker in a way that allows it to use the media buttons, just like it did with the Echo Dot?",bluetooth speaker medium button to control alexa music | hoping someone here can help so i used to have a first generation echo dot in my bathroom with a waterproof bluetooth speaker in the shower the speaker ha some button on it including next track and previous track answer hang up etc i used the next and previous button a lot with amazon music a they would skip track fast forward a few year and it came time to upgrade the echo dot in the bathroom to an old first generation full size echo the one where you can rotate the top to adjust the volume so i removed the bluetooth speaker pairing in the alexa app told my speaker to factory reset and repaired it with the new amazon echo and it mostly work fine however there are two difference first the echo pair with the speaker within a couple of second of me switching the speaker on thats actually good just different and maybe relevant with my old echo dot i always had verbally to tell it to pair the second difference and this is the annoying one is that those medium button dont work i cant skip track using the button and unfortunately the echo rarely hears me through the shower cubicle and over the noise of the water and the music ive tried unpairing and repairing and factory resetting the speaker a hundred time i suspect that originally the echo dot thought the bluetooth speaker wa a hand free kit by virtue of the fact it ha hang up and call button on it specifically for that purpose but thats a guess any idea how i can get the echo to pair with my bluetooth speaker in a way that allows it to use the medium button just like it did with the echo dot,309

amazonecho,SlickRebel231,Teen devices,"After reading through this forum, I feel as though my inquiry may be rather elementary; so I'm hoping someone can help me. 

My husband and I have an Amazon account, set up with a household (with our teenage daughter) so that we can all share the benefits of Prime from our respective accounts. We ran into an issue where our daughter would be trying to use the Echo to play music while we were away from the house. Our devices are set up on my Alexa app and, therefore, are linked to my music services. Consequently, as I'm driving down the road, my music pauses and begins playing at home. Then, a battle of music selection ensues. 

We each have our own Spotify accounts under a family plan, so my husband and I thought we would get a device for her to use with her own Spotify account. It was a perfectly sound idea! Until we tried setting the device up, that is. It seems that Amazon restricts teen accounts from having Amazon devices. I attempted to set the device up using FreeTime, but it's got all kinds of kid-friendly content and I have to monitor what she's doing (which I don't need to do with an Echo Dot). Furthermore, it won't let her play Spotify using her own account, and still results in the issue that we're trying to resolve.

Is there any way around this? Or am I going to need to create an adult account for her and pay for Prime separately for her?",2021-01-05 20:08:08,1,"Teen devices | After reading through this forum, I feel as though my inquiry may be rather elementary; so I'm hoping someone can help me.

amazonecho,cjw_5110,Groups not working as part of routines,"Hi all,

I can't find anything to help me here, and it's driving me somewhat insane.

I have a home office with the following setup:

* Office group:
   * Sub-group 1 ""Desk"" - Two Philips Hue candle lights
      * Desk Left
      * Desk Right
   * Sub-group 2 ""Office ceiling"" - Four Philips Hue white lights
      * Office Front Right
      * Office Front Left
      * Office Rear Right
      * Office Rear Left
   * Hue white light ""Office Shelf""
   * Echo dot
   * Smart plug ""Office heater""

I have two routines that I use daily:

* Alexa, get ready for work:
   * Brighten the desk to 75%
   * Turn on the office heater
* Alexa, I'm done working:
   * Turn off the office

For the past year, it's worked without any problem. However, last week, I removed my Echo dot for a couple days while I repainted the room. I also removed each of the lights at some point - the desk lights were off of power for three days, and the ceiling lights were each removed from their sockets (after turning the power off) for about a minute while I removed / reinstalled the can light housing.

Since I've gotten my room back together, I've found the following:

* When calling for a group to turn on or off, no problem - ""Alexa, turn off the desk"" results in both desk lights turning off, and ""Alexa, turn off the office ceiling"" results in all four can lights turning off
* When running a routine, things misbehave:
   * ""Alexa, get ready for work"" results in the office heater turning on but only the right desk light turning on (left stays off)
   * ""Alexa, I'm done working"" results in the left two ceiling lights, the right desk light, and the heater turning off, but the left desk light and the two right ceiling lights stay on.

I've changed the routine to control individual lights instead of the whole group, and that has solved the problem for now, but I'd like to get the groups to work within the routine. Other groups in the house and associated routines are unaffected.

I've tried resetting the lights (i.e. turn off and on twice), but that didn't solve the issue.

amazonecho,RedneckChinadian,Anyone here done a definitive test on Echo Studio vs. Apple HomePod?,"As the title states.  I currently have both but am torn deciding on which one for sound quality.  To me Echo Studio sounds better with a fuller and more dynamic sound that has far more midrange detail than HomePod could ever hope to deliver. What I find odd is almost every online review seems to favor HomePod’s sound quality and I often scratch my head wondering if I am tone deaf or if everyone else is tone deaf.  Both speakers certainly don’t sound crappy. Wanted to ask the folks here that are geared towards the echo line of products to share their $0.02 on the matter. 

Echo studio is priced very favorably and I managed to get a HomePod on the Apple Black Friday sale that helped lessen the sting at the cash register :)

I am not concerned about the smart speaker functionality of the speakers. We all know who the better one is. I want to get impressions of audio quality only.

amazonecho,Pawlson,How to have Alexa (Speakers and smart devices) working with multiple housemates?,"Hello all,

Sorry to bother you but I am seeking some help on how to configure my Alexa.

On our previous place we had a Google home setup where everyone could easily access to the Google home, Hue and whatever Smart home devices we using and for me and my house mates to share the access the only thing needed was an invitation to the house and it was ready to go and working fine on everyone's phones.

We moved to a new house and decided to give Amazon Echo/Alexa a chance, and here is where all the problems started. Seems like only I can access and control the devices in the house and can't find a way to invite other people to have the same access level like we had with Google Home. On the Alexa app I can see the hue lamp, but my mates can't see it on their Alexa app.

Also seems like there is a way to setup an Amazon Household but only allows 2 adults to be added and seems like it asks to share a wallet (which I would rather not),

So basically is there any way to configure Alexa to allow everyone living in the same house to have access to the smart devices in the house and access to the smart speakers without sharing a wallet (like we had with Google Home)?

amazonecho,BaylorZimm,Getting Started - Adding Zigbee to Dot v3,"Hi r/AmazonEcho,

I’m just getting started with my Amazon Echo Dot (Gen 3) &amp; would like to start a Smart home setup, starting with lighting first. Philip hue bulbs with a hub seem to be an obvious starting point. I’d be happy getting a Hue 3 bulb starter kit, but bulbs &amp; sensors to expand seem limiting &amp; expensive.

Would it be worth somehow adding a Zigbee hub to work alongside my Echo to allow access to a wider range of products like sensors &amp; door switches or is this going to cause more trouble than it’s worth mixing Hue with other products?

 I have no neutral wires throughout my house to convert the light switches, so replacing all my lights with Hue would be hellishly expensive. I’m also conscious about collecting a small stack of hubs to control everything with limited Ethernet ports on my current setup.

amazonecho,catennacio,How to play music from Windows 10 PC to Alexa group consisting of Echo Show 10 and Echo dot 4 with clock?,"So I have an Echo Show 10. I can pair it with my PC running Windows 10 and listen to the music on it and it works fine. Now, I just bought an Echo dot 4th gen with clock and want to play music from Windows on both devices at the same time. They are in the same room, but physical location shouldn't matter as long as they both connect to the same strong Wifi.

I use the Alexa app to ""Combine Speaker"". In there, the Stereo pair/subwoofer"" option won't work, because I can't select both Show and Dots at the same time. 

""Home Theater"" won't work either, because it says I don't have any Fire TV.

So I have to go with Multi-room music option. There's a ""Everywhere"" multi-room music created automatically. 

So the question is from Windows 10, how do I stream music to this group? I try to pair using Bluetooth, but Windows can only pair with 1 device at the same time. There's no bridge from Windows to Alexa world to pair with a device group.

Worst case, do I have to get 2 Echo Dot 4th gen to use ""Stereo pair/subwoofer"" option? What are my choices here Alexa gurus?

amazonecho,likewise991,Why is my Alexa playing ASMR by itself?,"This is kind of creepy. I have just setup an Alexa kids echo dot (the panda one) for my daughter. And this morning she has been freaked out and told me there was something wired going on “in” her Alexa.

It was fine until a few minutes later it paused in the middle of the song and started playing some wired noises again. I listened closely and realized it was some ASMR stuff. I asked Alex what it was playing, it responded with “This is He's One of My Favorite Characters from 100 Sounds of Gaming by Pelagea ASMR”.

amazonecho,Lellington1,Someone help before I throw Alexa off the balcony!,"Please, for the love of god help me!

I’ve had an Echo Dot for a couple of years now. It used to be great fun and I would use it to turn on my TV, Xbox and a load of other stuff. After time the gimmicky aspect of it died off and I just started using it as a speaker. 

Over Christmas I got an Echo Show 8. I love it! It’s actually a great piece of tech and has resparked my interest in smart tech once more. Well, that is until I’ve tried to connect it to my TV’s. 

I live in a small 1 bedroom apart in Dubai (not sure if location will affect the Alexa’s abilities). I have moved the Echo Dot into my bedroom and have the Echo Show in my living room. I have 2 Samsung TV’s. One in the living room and 1 in the bedroom. Both are connected on the SmartThings app and then connected to Alexa, however, I can’t control either of them! 

If I speak to the Dot in the bedroom, I can turn the bedroom TV off but not on and I can turn the living room TV on and off. 

If I speak to the Show in the living room, it just asks if I meant “Xbox”. It will not do any other functions at all. 

I’ve tried disconnecting every device and reconnecting them. I’ve tried connecting the Xbox to Alexa to see if that will get the Show to stop mentioning it but it won’t even control that. I’ve tried changing locations. Ive tried renaming the devices. I’ve tried everything that every YouTube tutorial and web article have told me to try. I feel like I’ve tried everything. 

I know it might seem dumb that all I want is to turn my stupid TV on with my voice but I’ve been trying to sort this for nearly 3 hours now. Someone please help me before I throw Alexa off the balcony. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions, I’ll try anything haha

amazonecho,DisgustingCoyote,Family Music Plan Help,"I know these conversations have been had on here already, but I couldn’t find an answer. Feel free to redirect me if it exists, but we have an Apple Music Family subscription. We have 4 echos dots that are all currently registered to the same Amazon account. MY account.

I can set three dots up individually with Amazon accounts for each user, but not all four because one of my kids are under 13, so one would have to share and that mixes up all the music preferences for two people. It also nixes the ”announce” feature which is kind of handy for a family. I know you can drop in, but announce is better for some things.

amazonecho,_Its_Never_Lupus_,Stranger is connecting to my Echo Show,"I have an Amazon Echo Show, and as of about a week ago, a stranger has been connecting to it via Bluetooth. At least ten times throughout the day, Alexa will announce ""now connected to Miccus Home RTX 2.0""; I have no idea who or what device that is. I can have my phone connected to it playing music, and it will actually disconnect my phone in order to connect to that strangers device. 

I live in a house many, many feet away from other neighbors, so it is not as though somebody is connecting to it through a wall as if I were in an apartment (not that they should be able to connect regardless). The only way that I can regain control of my device is to either tell Alexa to disconnect, or to unplug the Show altogether. 

It is quite clear that this person is intentionally connecting to my device. This is a serious invasion of privacy, as well as an annoyance when they're connecting at 7am playing techno music. I have tried turning off any features having to do with Bluetooth/Drop-in, but nothing has prevented this from happening.

Any advice is welcome and appreciated. If I can't stop this person from connecting to my device and invading my home, then the device will simply be returned to Amazon.

amazonecho,Cueball61,Alternatives to using a Dot/Flex in a high-humidity bathroom,"This comes up a lot but the general communal answer is “I use it in a bathroom and everything is fine”. That’s maybe fine in places like the States where the heating also dehumidifies, but in the UK our bathrooms can easily reach 90% humidity during a shower - and I know this because mine is exactly that right now.

For me that’s not an okay humidity to put an Echo in, and I’d probably see it die after the first shower in a bathroom where the tiled wall having condensation on after a shower is a normal thing.

That’s maybe fine in places like the States where the heating also dehumidifies, but in the UK our bathrooms can easily reach 90% humidity during a shower - and I know this because mine is exactly that right now.

For me that’s not an okay humidity to put an Echo in, and I’d probably see it die after the first shower in a bathroom where the tiled wall having condensation on after a shower is a normal thing.

amazonecho,Kaiparticus,Echo devices will not stop multiroom audio,"Hey Everyone,

I been running into an issue this past month - seems to happen when my router acts up and wifi drops for a few minutes.

When ever this happens, all my echo devices are linked for audio some how.  I would say something like ""resume podcast"", and every device will play it.  Rather than the single device I spoke to, which was the behavior up until recently.

I tried to removing the speaker groups, as well as re-adding them, but nothing seem to work.  The last time it happened, it seem to have fixed itself after an hour or so(after I got all the boxes out and was going to return them).  How it is happening again, and nothing seem to be working.  I'm really at my wits end here, and was even looking at how much it'll cost to replace everything with Google Nest.

Anyone here run into something like this and was able to resolve it?  I'm thinking the reconnection to the wifi after it comes back on is causing something to reset and link all the devices into a single audio group - even thought such group has not been set up.

amazonecho,Razor512,Is it possible to disable the red ring light on the Echo dot with clock (4th gen) when mic is muted?,"The Echo Dot with clock has the mute button light up, as well as a red ring illuminate when the mic is muted. The red ring is annoying, redundant, and annoying if using the device as an alarm clock, since it is very bright, especially since it doesn't reduce its brightness when the room lighting is off.

&amp;#x200B;

With this in mind, I would like to find a way to disable just the red ring, but keep the mute button illuminated so that there is a visual indicator of when the mic is muted.

So far I can't seem to find any setting to control it.

amazonecho,shmavalanche,4th Gen Echo + Hue when internet is down,"So I live in Nashville, just moved into a new apartment and invested a bunch of money in IoT devices.  Due to the bombing yesterday, my brand new ATT fiber line is down. 

I already planned (somewhat) for this possibility and 3 of my lights are Phillips hue bulbs connected directly to  my Echo 4th gen using zigbee.  I read that they would still be useable w alexa without a wifi connection, and 1 of the 3 is.  I can turn it on with voice no problem as before.  However, the other two are now unrecognized.  They were set up the exact same way(as far as I can remember), and are in 3 different groups.

I've tried the app, which doesn't recognize any of the lights (no internet), and asking alexa to turn on all lights in the groups doesn't work either.  When I ask alexa to turn on the lights by name the response is ""a few things share the name, which one did you want"" over and over.

So.  Is there any way to reset the hue bulbs that are not working and reconnect to alexa via zigbee?  Or maybe there is a command to find out what devices the echo knows about without internet access? (fyi the router works just fine, I can see all my IoT devices connected)

Thankfully the hues can be used manually, so it's not like I'm completely in the dark but would love to know if there is a no broadband workaround.

Thanks much for any advice.",2020-12-26 17:38:38,1,"4th Gen Echo + Hue when internet is down | So I live in Nashville, just moved into a new apartment and invested a bunch of money in IoT devices.  Due to the bombing yesterday, my brand new ATT fiber line is down.

I also have a similar problem on an Echo Show 8.

As I speak to the Echo Show while connecting with someone on their Alexa phone app, I hear my own voice echoing and repeating.

This causes me to sound like I’m cutting out or missing words to the person that is using their phone.

I don’t normally experience this with a Google Nest Hub Max that I’m also testing, but one time, I did hear my own voice as I spoke to the Nest Hub.

I told the person to restart their phone, and the echoing problem went away in the Nest Hub Max, but not the Echo Show 8.

Instead of using that person’s phone, we tried another phone.

Unfortunately, the echoing and repeating still occurred on the Echo Show when calling from a different phone, even though it was fine on the Nest Hub Max.

A factory reset of the Echo Show did not help.

This causes me to sound like I’m cutting out or missing words to the person that is using their phone.

I don’t normally experience this with a Google Nest Hub Max that I’m also testing, but one time, I did hear my own voice as I spoke to the Nest Hub.

I told the person to restart their phone, and the echoing problem went away in the Nest Hub Max, but not the Echo Show 8.

Instead of using that person’s phone, we tried another phone.

Unfortunately, the echoing and repeating still occurred on the Echo Show when calling from a different phone, but not the Nest Hub Max.

A factory reset of the Echo Show did not help.

I have no problem using Bluetooth earbuds to avoid the echoing when I call the person with the Echo Show, but I know that a lot of people who will be calling this Echo Show won’t be using one.

&gt; Echo Show calling echo show
&gt; 
&gt; I tried calling my daughter's echo show via my echo show. 
&gt; 
&gt; I hear terrible feedback and my own voice echoing back at me. 
&gt; 
&gt; She answered on her phone via Alexa. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is that the reason why I heard my voice echoing back at me? 
&gt; 
&gt; She said she heard me fine and wasn't getting her voice echoing back at her.

Playing music to a group? That is a total coin-flip... most of the time I have to recreate the group. I use my 4th gen devices for the same things I used my first gen for: Setting timers when I am cooking (yes, that is very valuable), playing music, and repeating commands 2 and 4 times to get my smarthings switch's to respond (when I am not disabling the skill, removing all devices from the echo app, relinking the skill and rediscovering all the devices to get the one malfunctioning one to work again.) Why is that? I think part of the reason is the ""skills library"" remains a cesspool of broken half implemented apps. I believe many of these apps exist only so the manufacturer can say their crapgadget is ""Alexa enabled"" but will never be made functional, much less updated. When will Amazon start doing some quality control?

amazonecho,AliLamyman,Question regarding Amazon Music Family Plan,"Hello everyone,

I don't know if there's an obvious solution to this, but I can't seem to see it if there is!

Some context to start 

I currently have the Amazon Music Family plan, which allows 6 of my family members to all have access to their own version of Amazon Music. They sign in with their own email addresses, and they can create their own playlsits etc. My partner, David, is one of these people.

I've also added my partner to our Amazon Household  , and our Echo Dot recognises both our voices (when asked to learn our voice she says ""X, I already know your voice) 

Now, here's the crux of the matter. When I ask Alexa to ""play my Christmas playlist"", my playlist, taken from my Amazon Music, is played. When David asks the same question, the response is ""I'm sorry I can't find that playlist"" OR it plays my playlist instead. 

However, when asked ""play David's Christmas playlist"" it will promptly play the correct playlist from his playlist. 

Any thoughts on how we can make it so that alexa plays the correct playlist depending on who addresses her?

amazonecho,kjvp,Can't control Wyze plugs with Alexa voice commands,"I got two Wyze plugs recently, and Alexa won't play nice with them. I connected the skill and she found the plugs with their correct names. The Alexa app shows the plugs and I can use the app to turn them on and off.

I've been able to control one of the plugs with a routine, but the other isn't responding to all the routines I add it to. (As in, in one routine it will turn off, but in another routine it just doesn't respond. It's consistent which ones work and which don't.)

I've tried disabling the skill, rediscovering the plugs and restarting the Echo, but I'm still having issues.

amazonecho,phantomlogic,Alexa Echo unable to turn on FireTV after inactivity,"So my Echo Show is paired to my FireTV and for the most part, everything works perfectly fine. I can use Alexa voice commands to turn on, turn off, and navigate through the FireTV.

However, the problem arises when I try to use Alexa to turn on the FireTV after some inactivity, i.e. the Firestick is likely in sleep mode. No voice commands seem to be able to wake it up. But if I were to press any button on the Firestick, like for instance, the volume button, and then issue an Alexa voice command to turn on the TV, then it works fine.

Obviously, the issue seems to be something having to do with the FireTV sleep state. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a big deal because I just have to press any button and I can be hands-free from that point on. But it would be nice to be able to walk into a room and turn on the TV without having to physically manipulate anything.

For those that are able to turn on their TV via Alexa even after a long period of inactivity, are you having to do anything in between? I've tried googling and using the reddit search function (lol) and I can't find anything about this, so I'm guessing maybe this isn't a common issue or I'm just missing something obvious. Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated?

Here are some relevant details:

* Want to play nature sounds/classical music/etc from local storage on the network (probably a staff computer?)
* Want to play particular files/playlists to each of 11 cat rooms, and occasionally groups of rooms or the full set
* Wifi signal is available and strong throughout the shelter
* Want to protect the speaker devices themselves from tampering/mischief by the visiting public (post-pandemic)
* Want to drive everything from a central location, probably a staff computer/mobile device

amazonecho,Sndr1988,Possibility to use colorloop/dynamic lights with Amazon Echo,"I recently purchased an Amazon Echo (4th gen) with the integrated Zigbee hub.

amazonecho,Ipse_Tase,Weird Echo Dot3 issue...going unresponsive,"Hope someone might have a suggestion, as Amazon support could not be bothered beyond replacing the device (didn't solve anything) and force a software update (which I'd say reduced the frequency of problems).
The way this happens is simple : out of the blue, the Echo Dot3 stops responding. No lights flickering, no error in the voice logs (no entry found, which means the device was not listening.
A power cycle ALWAYS solves the problem and I went from every  couple of hours to once a day or less after the software forced update.

Wi-Fi is strong in my office (I get around -50dB at the router from his device) and I tried both my 2.4 and 5GHz without any luck.

amazonecho,MashYeti,Echo Plus (2nd Gen) as a Smarthub Light bulb Issue,"Wasn't sure where else to post this, but I am unable to find an answer to my problem.

Now that kiddo is starting to explore what Alexa can do, is it possible he'll be able to listen in to our conversations through it when he's not here, without us knowing? Also, is there something like a search history that he could possibly find? 

For context, he has a few significant issues which we (and his other parent) work hard to help him through.

amazonecho,irrfin,Ecobee Alexa isn't recognized as a speaker option for multi-room setup,"I've been lurking in this sub for a few weeks as I prepare to setup my goal of whole home Alexa integration.  I'm especially interested in setting up rooms for different eco devices.  My daughters are constantly fighting over who gets to listen to their music on the single Eco dot we have right now.  I have 3 new Eco devices being delivered by Santa on Thursday evening.

In addition to our original echo dot, we have an ecobee thermostat that is Alexa enabled.  My challenge is that we will ask the Eco dot to play music, and sometimes the music gets redirected to the ecobee Alexa.  I seemed to have fixed that by making our living room Eco dot the primary speaker in the Alexa app.

When I attempted to make the ecobee Alexa the ""downstairs"" speaker, it's not available or recognized as a device/speaker in the Alexa app and therefore isn't an option in that setting.

How can I get my Alexa app to register the ecobee Alexa as a speaker device for a given room? Or can the ecobee Alexa not be used with my mater plan of whole home Alexa surveillance?

Part 2: it looks like I might have to buy the Amazon music family plan to achieve my goal of different rooms, different music.  Are there other options instead of paying $15/Mon?",2020-12-19 16:55:55,1,"Ecobee Alexa isn't recognized as a speaker option for multi-room setup | I've been lurking in this sub for a few weeks as I prepare to setup my goal of whole home Alexa integration.

amazonecho,belleessieo,Hue Lights Unresponsive,"I have multiple Hue lights in my home and 3 echo dots- I recently had a power outage, and all the lights that were off at the moment have been unresponsive and labeled as unresponsive in the Alexa app (I do not use a bridge). The lights that were on, were not affected. It’s been days of research and troubleshooting, however, I cannot get them to work. I’ve attempted the following multiples times based on my research:

1. In the Alexa app, I have manually reset all lights using the serial #- However, the reset appears to be unsuccessful with each bulb (Yes the lights were on)
2. I’ve deleted a couple of lights from the app, but now Alexa cannot find them in discovery mode. Another issue to add to this headache.
3. I’ve turned on and off lights x amount of times to “reset” based on Amazon recommendation.
4. I've unplugged light fixtures, and unplugged Amazon dots
5. I've reset my routers.
6. I’ve played around with the Alexa app, disabling/enabling lights.

I'm wondering if there's a hidden trigger / mechanism that realizes it cannot reach other devices directly on the network and it drops the connectivity in hopes you will put it back on the home network. I can't think of what else it could be. My access point is quite literally 4 ft away on the same side of the wall.

My ecobee thermostat, on the same vlan, using the same access point, never has this issue.

If it was just one of these 3rd gen echo dots I would assume a faulty device, but it's 3 of them - one of which is using a separate access point so I've ruled that out as well (as well as the other host of devices using the same network and access point)",2020-12-09 03:09:26,1,"I swear to God I'm gonna smash this thing | Every other day it drops internet connectivity.

amazonecho,shiginpit,Trouble with switching profiles on devices,"Hi all, recently set up house with Echo Plus + 3 dots around the house. Have groups built for each area an Alexa is in, including a few lamps + Christmas tree lights.

Setup was smooth, and I went into settings on the app to get the details just right.  Saw the new device has a temperature sensor, and it even lets me set routines based on the temperature it detects. Pretty neat trick.

It seems that I can set up routines based on what the echo is feeling, temperature wise, but it lacks the software self-awareness to tell me what the temperature it's detecting is.

   I hope someone on reddit can help me. I have a house full of Echos: multiple dots, 2- Echo Show 5's, and a 3rd gen Echo speaker. I also have multiple family members: 3 adults (myself, my wife, and my 19 year old daughter) and 1 teenager (13 year old son). I pay for spotify premium family and we all have our own accounts under my family plan.

   I want to be able to have all the Echo's listed under my account. That way I can monitor and make changes as necessary under my wifi however I want my Echo environment to recognize who it is speaking with ( which should be possible under voice profiles) and play music under their respective spotify account. My issue is, when i'm at work and Im listening to spotify and if my son ask alexa to play music, it kicks me off my spotify and starts playing his music on my phone. Also, I don't want to share prime benefits because my daughter pays for amazon prime student separately. I strictly want household for Alexa, nothing else.

   I also want to keep all the echos under one main account profile because I have smart devices throughout the house also. (i.e. philip hue bulbs, august smartlock, MyQ garagedoor opener, ring's, etc) Therefore, I want everyone to be able to control everything since we are all under one roof.

   Why is this so difficult? Google allows up to 6 user profiles under google home and each one is allowed to have separate services from my understanding. I'm seriously considering buying an google nest home and trialing it and possibly switching.

  I like the Alexa environment and I'm fairly well invested in the architecture however it is not satisfying my needs currently. Please help!

amazonecho,bramnet,Notifications stop after 11PM,"So this one's weird, we've been using Alexa for our household for almost a year now and we now have 4 different dots throughout the household. Something my father does to get a hold of me and my brother is that he sends a message though the dot to us for questions or if he needs something fetched.

But if I turn the smart switch on to turn on the light (and I want it to STAY on), and then someone walks in front of the camera, it will then turn off light in 5 minutes. Any way to solve this?

amazonecho,ElTuxedoMex,I did something wrong... But now I have Netflix on my Echo Show 5?,"I got my wife and Echo Show 5 as a gift and I had no idea how to use it previous to that, so I've been playing around and learning and whatnot. So then I learnt it has no Netflix, which is a big bummer because my wife likes to watch it while working. As a side note, I'm in Mexico, not USA, I bring up this little detail just in case it might be important later.

Anyway, I was fiddling around, noticed it had Firefox, browsed to Netflix, logged in and of course tells me I need an app and does nothing. Whatever. I remember it has another browser, Silk. So I open Silk, browse to Netflix again, log in, try to open a movie... and this time there's a pop up that asks me how I want to handle the link, if using something something (it looked like an android file thing) or Netflix. I choose Netflix, it loads something and suddenly I'm in a Netflix app! And it works like a charm, I can use it, play movies, browse my collection, everything! 

So I go back to Home, browse to the video tab and there's Netflix! But it doesn't do anything. If I ask Alexa to open Netflix, it tries but says there's an error and can't open it. But, if I go to Silk, browse to Netflix and choose a profile, the app opens again!

amazonecho,Rimbaud33,Can you program commands inside routines?,"Can you program a voice command into an Alexa routine?

Can you make a routine triggered by, for example: “Alexa, time to play video games” and with just that one command execute a series of commands that are not commonly available in routines like “Alexa, start Apex Legends on Xbox” 

My point is I want to be able to turn on my Xbox, set a lighting scene and turn on my monitor with just one command and then turn all of them off with another one. But if I use the Xbox skill on routines it just tells me “welcome to Xbox, use a command like...” there is no option to add a skill command, (like turn on Xbox or start apex legends). Only to open the skill, which is useless since it just adds an extra needless step (using voice commands, you can ask Alexa to turn on Xbox without asking her to open the skill first)

I figured maybe if there was a way to make Alexa execute a voice command as if I had said it Inside of a routine I could go around this.

Shoving 5 low end speakers in a box, with a subwoofer on the bottom is not dolby atmos lol. That thing wouldnt even go loud enough to actually be able to even hear 16 bit music, which needs at least 97dbs.

Judging by the reviews none of these people even know what good is.

Espically with that, hes actually saying it is garbage lol but thinks it grand. Even my cheap reciver doesnt change the music while playing, that isnt quailty.

amazonecho,wtporter,Upgrade?,"Hi all. So I’ve never really followed the Echo upgrades models to models. I have a number of the various models around the house and typically just get whatever the newest one is, when they go on sale. Mostly Dots and recently a number of Flex. 

I have a SmartThings hub and have been implementing smart home stuff for a while and the word is the spouse (I mean Santa) is making a Hubitat hub show up this Xmas. 

My original Echo is a Gen 1. The tower with the volume ring. The current 4th Gen is on sale for $69. Do I upgrade and swap out the Gen 1 and repurpose it elsewhere or pass it along to someone else that could use it?

I’m not sure exactly the benefits of the new one other than the addition of the Zigbee hub like the Plus had. Will it hear us better if the volume is loud in the room (also good question for my mom, if the ability to detect voice is better then she may get a new one also as a gift from me). 

Thanks for any advice and for the valuable time spent answering what is probably a goofy question (upgrade a 4 generation old device? Duh, of course!)

amazonecho,flasozzi,Echo dots 4 playing routines in a wrong way like they're misunderstanding them,"This issue has been happening to both myself and a friend of mine. We both have echo dots 4th gen and apparently we've been experiencing it for the same period of time (around 2 days). No, we don't share a house, so we're talking about different locations altogether.

Routines which were previously well executed now end up as if they were something else entirely which seems to include playing a very random song. My friend's Alexa is doing similar things, but mine is easier to exemplify:

Routine: 1- turn on the lights; 2- say good morning; 3- say the date; 4- say the weather etc.

What Alexa does: 1- turn on the lights; 2- play a song called Good Day (?) and stop right there.

My routines are triggered by time, while hers are trigged by saying a sentence (which she has tried changing but didn't make any difference).

Seems like Alexa's messing the commands up, maybe believing that ""say good morning"" means ""play good day""? 

Today my friend's Alexa played the very same song as mine, but yesterday she played a French song called How Is The Weather In Paris (I'd bet her routine included telling the weather, though unfortunately we don't live anywhere near Paris).

I haven't tried anything yet, but she says she's tried rebooting her device but to no avail.

Not sure it makes any difference, but our mother tongue is Brazilian Portuguese and that's the language we use in our devices. However, the songs that are randomly played always have English titles.

Have you guys been experiencing similar issues? Since we're talking about two different devices, I find it hard to believe it's an isolated issue and I'm hoping someone has been able to solve it.

I've checked Amazon's silly tip to make sure the mute button isn't activated and more importantly it is registering the stop command, it's just starting more of them. I've tried unplugging it for several hours and it does the exact same thing when plugged back in.

amazonecho,makenziepaulson,Do you recommend Amazon Echos?+ Help with setting up an echo dot?,"I literally JUST bought and picked up an Echo Dot. My boyfriend has been interested in the HomePod for a while, but it’s $300 price tag was a little scary. Apple just released the HomePod mini a while ago, but even the $99 price tag was mildly intimidating. 

I decided to buy him one for a Christmas gift, and was interested in one myself. I like the compact size of the HomePod that’s basically like a large softball. I have a speaker in my bathroom, a UE Boom Mini from *years* ago, and a JBL clip. I have working speakers and only really listen to music in the car or while in the shower/getting ready to start my day, so a $99+ speaker seemed like a waste of money. But I’m the kind of person who follows my
boyfriend. If I like an item he has and I think I’d find it practical, I end up wanting it. 

I did some Googling and tried to see if a HomePod Mini would be useful for me at all, or if it truly would be a waste of $99, and saw some comparison articles between HomePod, Echo, and Google Home (?). I kind of just figured the Echo &amp; the Google Home are like, Amazon &amp; Google’s version of a bluetooth speaker. 

My boyfriend got a free Google Home Mini a while back. I think it was a free item with a purchase for *something* which he uses to control his lights. When I checked out the Echo Dot, it came with a free light bulb, so I figured it’d do the same thing. Pair some light bulbs, get a fun speaker, only spend $30. 

We literally spent like an hour trying to pair the lights. (They’re Sengled. I tried the Sengled &amp; Mixtile skills on the Alexa app, I tried the Sengled app — nothing). 

I also have this [ir]rational fear of smart devices like Alexa and Google Home. I’m terrified they’re going to wake up on their own, get a mind of their own, basically take over the human race — you know, nothing serious. [But on a serious note, I am afraid they’ll “do their own thing” and break my privacy. Which is odd, considering I *do* use Apple devices almost religiously. I have my MacBook, my iPads, my iPhone, etc. So Apple has my fingerprint and face scans stored away. Plus, social security numbers, all that jazz. It’s not like I’m *not* on file somewhere] Additionally, I’ve seen some people had issues with Sidewalk turning on on it’s own. That’s one of the few things I did NOT want on, so during set up I made sure to click NO, and after going into settings I saw that it was in fact, turned on. 

I’m a total Apple sheeple, and am wondering if this Echo Dot is even going to be a respectable purchase for me? Or is it going to be a terribly spent $30? Literally, just the thought that my Alexa could wake up in the middle of the night and have some random person hack into my home terrifies me and is currently one of the main deciding factors urging me to return it. What are your experiences with your Echo device (or even *any* smart-home devices) 

Additionally, how do you actually set it up with lights? I figure if something actually had gone significantly wrong in terms of privacy/the uprising of the devices, there’d be news stories and a halt in production. So my fears are most likely quite irrational, and unrealistic. 

We did the reset by flickering the lights, I added the Mixtile AND the Sengled “skills” in the app, I googled it, I downloaded the actual Sengled app, etc. I literally could not get my Echo/Alexa App to pair with my lights. I have 1 sengled mesh LED light (which came in the bundle) and 2 sengled smart wifi LED lights. Both say they’re pairable with bluetooth, and yet I couldn’t get them to pair ://

TIA",do you recommend amazon echo help with setting up an echo dot | i literally just bought and picked up an echo dot my boyfriend ha been interested in the homepod for a while but it s 300 price tag wa a little scary apple just released the homepod mini a while ago but even the 99 price tag wa mildly intimidating i decided to buy him one for a christmas gift and wa interested in one myself i like the compact size of the homepod that s basically like a large softball i have a speaker in my bathroom a ue boom mini from year ago and a jbl clip i have working speaker and only really listen to music in the car or while in the shower getting ready to start my day so a 99 speaker seemed like a waste of money but i m the kind of person who follows my boyfriend if i like an item he ha and i think i d find it practical i end up wanting it i did some googling and tried to see if a homepod mini would be useful for me at all or if it truly would be a waste of 99 and saw some comparison article between homepod echo and google home i kind of just figured the echo amp the google home are like amazon amp google s version of a bluetooth speaker my boyfriend got a free google home mini a while back i think it wa a free item with a purchase for something which he us to control his light when i checked out the echo dot it came with a free light bulb so i figured it d do the same thing pair some light bulb get a fun speaker only spend 30 we literally spent like an hour trying to pair the light they re sengled i tried the sengled amp mixtile skill on the alexa app i tried the sengled app nothing i also have this ir rational fear of smart device like alexa and google home i m terrified they re going to wake up on their own get a mind of their own basically take over the human race you know nothing serious but on a serious note i am afraid they ll do their own thing and break my privacy which is odd considering i do use apple device almost religiously i have my macbook my ipads my iphone etc so apple ha my fingerprint and face scan stored away plus social security number all that jazz it s not like i m not on file somewhere additionally i ve seen some people had issue with sidewalk turning on on it s own that s one of the few thing i did not want on so during set up i made sure to click no and after going into setting i saw that it wa in fact turned on i m a total apple sheeple and am wondering if this echo dot is even going to be a respectable purchase for me or is it going to be a terribly spent 30 literally just the thought that my alexa could wake up in the middle of the night and have some random person hack into my home terrifies me and is currently one of the main deciding factor urging me to return it what are your experience with your echo device or even any smart home device additionally how do you actually set it up with light i figure if something actually had gone significantly wrong in term of privacy the uprising of the device there d be news story and a halt in production so my fear are most likely quite irrational and unrealistic we did the reset by flickering the light i added the mixtile and the sengled skill in the app i googled it i downloaded the actual sengled app etc i literally could not get my echo alexa app to pair with my light i have 1 sengled mesh led light which came in the bundle and 2 sengled smart wifi led light both say they re pairable with bluetooth and yet i couldn t get them to pair tia,708

amazonecho,saulhansell,Please help me set up Echo Show for an elderly uncle who just entered nursing home,"Hi all-

  I have an elderly uncle who just entered a nursing home. I purchased an Echo Show for him and I'd like a bit of advice on the best way to set it up. He's smart and curious, but his memory is shot, so there's no way I can count on him remembering any instructions I give him. I will send him a poster of a few common Alexa commands to prompt him.

**ACCOUNT**

Should I set the Echo up on my Amazon account or should I create a separate account for my uncle (to which I could log in, if needed)?

**DROP IN VIDEO CALLS**

This is the main reason I got the Echo Show. I didn't buy an Echo Show for myself. I have audio only Echos, but I figure I'd do video calls from the app on my phone. Does this work well? If he calls me, can I have it ring on my phone, but not the echo devices in my house? 

**MUSIC**

He likes to listen to music. I can set him up on my Apple Music family plan, or is it better to get him an Amazon Music subscription? Can I remotely turn on music for him?

**NEWS**

He's interested in news and doesn't have a television in his room. I am a big fan of the NPR One audio skill and I'll set him up with that, but I don't know video skills. Are there any skills that can start an up to date video newscast with a simple audio command?

Any other tips that would help me set up the Echo Show before I send it and the instruction poster to him?

Thanks

amazonecho,CliffordTheDragon,Echo dot audio related questions.,"Hello friends,
I have an echo dot (3rd gen) in my living room, along with a Vizio smartcast TV, which has a built in chrome cast, and a Vizio sound bar. The soundbar is connected to my TV with HDMI ARC, and the echo dot through bluetooth.

When I set the input on my sound bar to ARC, it will also play bluetooth sounds, so I can still interact with my echo without changing inputs.

With that background info out of the way, here are my questions.

1) My TV in general is pretty loud, so setting the volume to 10/12 is usually more than enough. But when talking to my echo, 10/12 volume is not enough to hear her speak to me. Is there any way to balance the two? I have my echo turned up all the way on the app. 

1.5) If there is not a way to balance them, how do I get my echo to talk over the built in speaker, and play music and things through the soundbar? I have the speaker set to ""Built-in speaker"" on the alexa app, but it still talks through the sound bar. 

2) I want to play music from spotify through my sound bar. My initial idea was to cast spotify to the TV through echo, which would then play out the sound bar. The Vizio Smartcast does not have a spotify app, but it does have a chromecast that can cast spotify. When I tell alexa to play music it just tells me my Vizio does not have the app. Is there any way to program her to cast to the built-in chrome cast?

2.5) If there is no way to cast to the chrome cast, is there a way to get the echo to play music through the sound bar as a bluetooth speaker, without interacting with the TV. Right now when I try to get it to play through the speaker it just assumes I want the TV and tells me again the TV doesn't have the app.

I hope these questions make sense, I'm happy to provide more context. Thanks guys.",2020-11-29 16:42:32,1,"Echo dot audio related questions. | Hello friends,

amazonecho,SHADOWSTRIKE1,How to set up different households?,"Hey everybody, I’m really hoping someone can help me out here.

So here’s my situation... my mom is the primary Amazon account and pays for Prime.  I had made a separate account (I guess sub account?) with my own email, which has my own shoppings lists, payments, address, etc. but still maintains the benefits of her Prime.  Two different households.

A couple years ago I picked up an Echo Plus for my apartment and set it up and attached it to my account.  A couple months ago, I got one for my mom as well for her to use in her house.  I set that one up via her tablet and logging into her account.

Now, I noticed in my Alexa app on my phone that it not only lists my devices (Echo Plus, Hue bulbs, etc), but also her devices (Echo Plus, firesticks, etc).  I didn’t really think much of it and let it go.

Well, my sister just tried to “drop in” on my mom, but it went to my Echo instead... this leads me to believe that even though I registers it under my own subaccount, it still considers my Echo to be a part of her account and name.

In my Alexa app, I can see my device is named after me, and it’s location and network are totally different from hers.

Is there a way to group these devices under each different profile?  Can I create different household groups for our devices?  Do I need to just create my own whole Amazon account completely separate from hers and sign up for Prime on my own?",2020-11-25 20:01:59,1,"How to set up different households? | Hey everybody, I’m really hoping someone can help me out here.

I’m really happy with it, but I’ve noticed it has MASSIVE trouble hearing the trigger word. I tested out my old Echo Dot for comparison and it picked up my voice absolutely fine. I’ve had to say “Alexa” 3-4 times before my new Echo registers. 

Has anyone else run into this problem? And if so, how did you solve it?

amazonecho,jche2,Trigger Routine from Guard alarm notification?,"I have an ADT wired system. I have screen-enabled Alexa devices throughout the house. I also have Wyze cams throughout the house. 

Alexa now has the ability to trigger any action you want in a routine via a customizable “text to trigger” command. 

I’ve tried this on things like “when motion sensor detects motion between XYZ times, show me the living room”. And now I can see right from my nightstand the living room every time there’s motion at night. It’s great. 

I want to extend this to my ADT alarm. When the alarm goes off, BOTH Alexa Guard AND the Wyze alarm detection feature will be triggered. I want this to also trigger a camera feed of my front door or foyer, however the Wyze alarm detection can’t currently trigger an Alexa routine nor can guard alerts. 

Any ideas how to achieve this? I can’t think of a way that a virtual switch or sensor would be helpful here.

I haev an echo show and am having some issues with it.  Here is some context about the device.

It allows all of us (her kids - around the world) to chat with her without her having to really do anyhing (except respond) to activate the call.  It's honestly been a godsend and she absolutely loves it because it makes her less reliant on whoever she's staying with to make / receive calls, and it;s been really nice talking to her more often. 

Recently, on a few of our phones, in the alexa ap, the device now shows as offline. Others are able to drp in ust fine. Does anyone know what might be causing this? FWIW we're all logged into the same account the device is registered to on the app to make dropping in easier.

amazonecho,digitalpencil,Is it possible to disable everything on Echo show except ability to receive video calls?,"Want to get one of these for my mother in law so we can drop in on her, initiate video calls from our side and all they have to do is hit the big green button and they can see their grandchild.

I cannot begin to overemphasise just how technically limited these people are. Her father has a smartphone but once recorded over an hour of youtube using the camera app. No amount of phone calls explaining what series of buttons to press in the event of something going wrong will work.

So naturally i'm after a completely zero config device their side. I'm hoping i can set it up once, and then leave it there on the side and if they unplug it to plug in the vacuum cleaner or whatever, all the have to do is plug it back in again and after a few mins, it works again.

I don't want ""alexa"", definitely no ads or suggested skills popping up or anything like that. The screen should be always off unless we call them and then all the have to do is accept the call.

Aware there are a bunch of competing devices in this space, is this possible with Echo show? I'm basically hoping there's a geriatric 'accessible' mode you can put it in or something?

amazonecho,Anonymous_Bozo,Amazon Music issues with Two Devices in near proximity.,"I've started seeing a very annoying issue.  

I have a Fire-TV Cube in the living room hooked up to my Entertainment system and sound bar.  There is also an Echo in the Kitchen.   To prevent the wrong device from responding, I've programmed the echo to respond to the name Amazon instead of Alexa.   This has worked perfectly until recently.

Now when I say ""Alexa, play some classic rock""

Alexa responds with ""Playing Classic Rock from Amazon Music""

The echo in the kitchen hears the word ""Amazon Music"" and responds with:

""I found a playlist you might like"" and begins playing a totally different playlist.  Somehow the Echo is faster and starts before the Cube can start; causing the Cube to respond that my Amazon Music  account is being used on another device (My account currently only allows one device to stream at a time).

I don't want the Echo to play music, it's speaker sucks and it's in the wrong room.

Other than changing the Wake Word for the Echo to something else can anyone think if what I might do to prevent this?   I thought these devices were supposed to be smart enough to not respond to themselves talking!   I tried changing it to Computer, but we watch a lot of Star-Trek and it loves to respond to Kirk and Picard.   The last thing I need is for Kirk to tell the Computer to Self Destruct!  :)   (Fortunately Alexa usually responds that she doesn't know how to do that).  


It's usually easier to reprogram Alexa than it is to retrain my Wife to use a new Wake Word.",2020-11-21 00:19:38,1,"Amazon Music issues with Two Devices in near proximity. | I've started seeing a very annoying issue.

amazonecho,Finnzz,Solution to FireTV Cube &amp; Echo Studio intermittent audio breakup,"I've been dealing with the audio intermittently breaking up / dropping out when using Home Theater mode with the FireTV Cube and Echo Studio.  I have found one major flaw in the setup that I have tried to relay to Amazon support, but they seem uninterested / incompetent.  So I'm posting here in hopes this may help others.

Short answer, the problem is bandwidth saturation.  

More specifically, the 100Mbps micro USB adapter from Amazon is becoming saturated regularly when video buffer is being refilled, disrupting the stream of audio from the FireTV to the Echo Studio.  

**Solution:**  Don't use the Amazon ethernet adapter with your FireTV device.  Use 5Ghz WiFi (\~600Mbps throughput theoretically).  Or buy a gigabit ethernet adapter (limited to 480Mbps due to the USB 2.0 interface).  
[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N2ZHFY9](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N2ZHFY9) (only one I could find, and which I bought and works for me).

A third solution would be to use your router to limit the download rate on the FireTV device to \~90Mbps, so that there is always enough bandwidth left for the 0.5-1Mbps home theater audio stream to the Echo Studio.

They gave her a device which transmits important info from her pacemaker to doctors, a mycarelinkrelay 24960. She has four smart lights, two controlled by tan tan smart switches, two which use the hub based Philips hue bulbs. When getting ready to hit the hay she told a tan tan lamp to turn off, and it likewise turned off the mycarelinkrelay 24960 unit. It replicated the same thing with me on the phone. This did not happen with the Philips bulbs when given commands. And today it seems this issue is not happening, regardless, we're choosing to replace the tan tan switches with Philips bulbs to keep this from happening again. We both wanted to pass this through to others and wonder if there's an explanation anyone would have about this weird, and potentially dangerous issue (from what we both understand, if just once that signal did not get through to doctors, it would/could NOT be good at all), and could slip by even being noticed by many with pacemakers.

Please can you help,
 
I have just got the latest Echo Dot (Ball shape 4TH Gen) and the latest 4K Fire TV Stick ( Autumn 2020). I have linked them both. 
 
When I ask the Echo Dot Alexa to open Netflix or YouTube, etc, on Fire TV, she says 'Getting Netflix on Fire TV' and brings up the app page with Netflix (etc) and other apps listed. 

I then have to ask her to open it again to open the app.
 
This behaviour is inconsistent too. She always searches for the apps but there are some she won't open. On the second ask, she just does an additional search. With apps such as My 5, (I'm in the UK) she won't actually open it.

amazonecho,OCQuest,"Random disconnects, display errors, playing wrong songs, stopping to play music at all and other bugs with Amazon Music App"," 

I am having constant bugs with Amazon Music App, when using the app on an android device to connect with my Echo device.

I  happens very often, normally every other 3 - 5 songs one of the may  bugs happens. It never happens that i can listen to a full album from  start to end without any issues.

I tried it on 4 different android devices, two smartphones and two tablets. One of them is even an amazon device (Fire HD 10).

On  all 4 devices i have the same issues. Support replaced the Fire HD 10,  but i knew it wouldnt work anyway on a replacement device since it is  the same issues on all 4 android devices, but the support wanted to do  it.

I think it is very clear that there are huge issues with the amazon music app, it is not an hardware/device error.

I  copy this from antoher post, because it is already a very good  description of all the random bugs that happens when playing music:

* When streaming to any echo device, there are many issues:
* \- randomly not finding the echo at all, option to connect is greyed out
* \- randomly plays another song that is not the next in the album row or playlist row
* \- randomly loses connection to app and keeps playing, requires a reset to regain control
* \- randomly stops playing, requires reset to regain control
* \- says my device is currently streaming with no way of selecting - requires reset
* When just being used independently:
* \- randomly loses control of UI
* \- requires reset - missing songs in albums, requires reset
* Display errors on music app:
* \-  Plays next song but display is stuck on last song; fixed by pressing  pause and play but if you dont do it, it will lose connection to echo,  requires reset to regain control

It is really frustating, because all i want is listen to music but it constantly produces stupid errors.

My  solution so far: Canceled my Amazon Music Unlimited subscription and  will  check the remaining runtime if it will be fixed. if not, spotify  is my  next subscription..

amazonecho,prolixia,Custom online images as Echo Show wallpaper,"I love the Bing Image of the Day and wanted to have a similar cycling background on my Echo Show 5.  Not a photo album, but images pulled from URLs that I specify.  I did it and it works great, so I wanted to share.  A word of caution though - I use Home Assistant to do this (it's an excellent free and open-source smarthome platform) so if you're not an HA user then it's unlikely to help you.

If you use HA then once you've got it linked to your Echo devices (either using HA's paid-for cloud service, or manually), changing the background on an Echo Show is super-easy.   First you'll need to add the Alexa Media Player integration - but you probably already did that after you linked HA to Alexa.

The golden nugget that unlocks custom backgrounds is the knowledge that if you try to ""play"" an image on one of the Echo Show models using Alexa Media Player then what actually happens is that it's set as the background.  Once you know this, then you can ""play"" any image URL at any time to set the background. 

I used a Node Red flow to change the background at midnight every day to the Bing image of the day - you can find [a brief write-up with the code here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nodered/comments/jkddqk/changing_echo_show_background_to_the_bing_image/).

I loved that so much that I wanted a more frequent change of background as I worked and discovered Picsum who serve up a random image at your specified resolution - and they're generally pretty nice images.  So I created a new flow to ""play"" the URL [https://picsum.photos/960/480](https://picsum.photos/960/480) (native resolution of the Show 5 screen) every 15 mins during working hours.  It works like a charm and the images look great on the Show's screen.

That's it, really.  Apologies for danging such a tasty morsel in front of those of you who don't use HA, but for those that do you should definitely consider this - it's transformed my enjoyment of the Show 5 that sits on my desk and is basically a glorified clock.",2020-11-19 12:43:04,1,"Custom online images as Echo Show wallpaper | I love the Bing Image of the Day and wanted to have a similar cycling background on my Echo Show 5.

So here's my question: I currently use a crappy sound bar with my record player and was wondering if I could plug my record player into this audio in jack to hear it's audio come out of the Echo 4. Is this possible?

amazonecho,skateordie03,Buttons for Grandparents,"My grandparents are in their 90's and we are trying to simplify everything for them.

Thanks for all the suggestions!  All the ideas really got me thinking and I believe the first thing I will try is buying a few different buttons that can hold voice recordings.

amazonecho,mustardclouds,Amazon Echo Dot won’t play more than 3 songs on spotify,"I’ve had this issue for a while but I’ve neglected it until now.

I notice as well the music display will lag/pause on the first song that is played, even when it’s playing a different song - it does this on both the spotify and alexa app. The only way i can continuously play music is by watching spotify constantly and skipping through when the display pauses, which is just really annoying to watch constantly.

amazonecho,BaklaFiroz,Play PC audio to two Alexas in stereo,"Hi Reddit,

So I have bought a second echo dot and  successfully paired the devices. When I ask Alexa to play muisic from spotify/amazon everything works great.

However, when I ask Alexa to connect to my PC via bluetooth it only plays through one device. To make matters worse, the other device (which I sit slightly closer to sometimes) often heres my command first and seems to tell the primary echo to ignore me.

For example:

Me: ""Alexa, call XYZ""

Alexa A: ""Calling XYZ""

\*\*\* User has call with XYZ \*\*\*

Me: ""Alexa end call""

Alexa B: ""There is no active call""

I either have to ask the other person to end the call or turn the mircrophone off on Alexa B for Alexa A to respond. The fact that Alexa A completely ignores me unless I whisper to it or turn the microphone off on Alexa B would indicate that they are communicating in some way.

How can this system be so shite?

1. Is there any way to watch a movie on my PC using both Alexas in stereo, like I can when directly connecting to music services

I'm trying to understand the limits of functionality between everything. I've tried to name the flex ""echo"" , to have some separation between the units, as only one fire TV device is linkable to each echo. This is the first night so I'm having growing pains. 

What I'm trying to do is have the upper tv respond to the 4th Gen as ""Alexa"" and lower TV respond to the flex as ""echo"". 

This isn't happening. Even though I've disabled the Samsung tv, both echos turn my upper TV off and on, and neither want anything to do with the lower TV. 

Am I asking a lot from a limited service? 

I'm getting a lot of this TV/device doesn't support this. 

I've gone through the correct necessary steps to connect everything, but having 2 units in one room seems to be mucking it up. 

Ultimately the whole point was to turn both tvs on and off and switch inputs in the event of a lost remote. 

The Samsung smart TV could never turn on without the firestick, while I could control everything else when on. 

The Visio had no problems with a firestick being commanded via echo before the addition of the 2nd.

amazonecho,jameslee85,"Alexa, why do you make it so hard to love you?","I'm a relatively new convert to Alexa. A few months ago, I bought the Echo Studio which I now use for Spotify. I've never set up Amazon Music, and a few astute readers may already see where this is going. 

Shortly after, I bought a few Echo Dots, and a Show. One of the dots is now in my bedroom. I've disabled all notifications, and all recommendations - I only want Alexa to wake and tell me things either when I receive a message, or when I specifically ask something.

Cue 5am this morning when I'm awoken not by my new born baby, but by a bright yellow light in my face that ""an artist I follow on Amazon Music"" has released a new album (it's AC/DC if you're interested). 

Where do you find the option to disable this notification? Not in the Alexa app where you would expect it, no. Amazon music website? Not unless you want to visit each artist one by one and unfollow - but that doesn't help if you don't know which artists you've been signed up to follow. Instead, I had to download the amazon music app to my phone, sign in, go to my profile, and only there could I find the follow list. My only way to stop the notifications is seemingly to unfollow all artists - which if I were an active user of this service, would likely be a real annoyance. 

This is just one minor annoyance Alexa has given me. ""By the way"" and constant suggestions are also part of this iceberg.

Alexa would be so good if she would just do what I ask her, and stop trying to guess what I want at unreasonable hours in the morning.

amazonecho,FobbingMobius,Hmmm I don't see any smart home devices," Last night, everything worked fine.

Now, the Plus in my main living room responds with ""Hmmm I don't see any smart home devices."" Lights and devices respond to some other Echo devices (dots in other rooms), and control through the app on my Android works.

I've restarted the Plus in my main living room, with no help

Normal commands work on some Alexa devices.

All Alexa devices show up and appear normal in the app.

I've verified that I'm on/using the correct ""account""

Further testing:

On the Show I have in my kitchen, when I interact by voice I get the same ""Hmmm I don't see any smart home devices etc."" response, but when I use the screen, all devices show up, and I can touch to control (on, off, varying dim amounts) all of the smart home devices I can see or hear.

I have an Echo Plus (with hub) and a Philips Hue hub, two ecobee thermostats, two Echo Shows, and a collection of Dots.

When I test with ""Alexa, turn on dad's light"" I get:

Plus: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.)

Ecobee 1: works

Ecobee 2: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.)

Kitchen show: Hmmm. I don't see any smart home devices (etc.) (but control from the touch screen works)

Bedroom dot: works

Bath dot: works

Garage dot: works from some devices, but not for others

Workshop show: Works for some devices, but not for others. (but all devices show up and can be controlled from the touch screen)

I've confirmed the wifi is working, and the signal strength is strong at all devices. Both Shows indicate good connection strength to the wifi.

I've restarted the Hue Hub I also have, even though I'm not really sure it's controlling any of the lights.

This is very odd.

amazonecho,JoeDin77,Alexa &amp; Playlists,"Hi all,

So recently I purchased 2 Echo Dots for the first time. There are 3 users in my house that use them, and we have owned them now for around a month.

I recently upgraded my Prime membership to include Prime Music Unlimited. While listing to music the other 2 users created a play list each and kept adding songs to it.

One of the playlists is called Jackie's and the other was called Mick's.

If someone wants to listen to Jackie's all we have to do is say ""Alexa play Jackie's playlist"" and it starts to play.

But with Mick's we have been having issues. First off Alex crated it as Mixs and not Mick's so I renamed it on the website.

Then if we said ""Alexa play Mick's playlist""  it would name some other random playlist on Amazon Music and play that.

So thinking Mick's is too easy to mistake as other words we renamed it to Tessa's. Now if we say ""Alexa play Tessa's playlist"" it still names a random playlist on Amazon Music 

But if we say ""Alexa play my Tessa's playlist"" it then plays the correct playlist.

So I was just wondering why this is happening. Jackie's plays without issue  ut the other we have to state its ""my"" playlist or it will play somthing with a similar name from Amazon music.

Is there away we can get it to work so it will play it without us having to say ""my"" each time I know its only 1 extra word but it just makes it a mouth full to say.

Thanks Joe.",2020-11-11 15:47:43,1,"Alexa &amp; Playlists | Hi all,

amazonecho,Babybunny424,Issue with music on routines?,"Hi,

I have some routines set at scheduled times, basically to use as an alarm clock in the morning and then a playlist for another point in my day when I do housework. I like it to play a certain song for the morning and a certain playlist for the other because it helps me to associate that with waking up/housework, rather than just random music which my brain just ignores as it’s not the routine. I use Spotify as my music provider. It’s always worked fine. However recently I had a problem where the song I use for morning wasn’t being found, so for a few mornings in a row instead of my nice music I was woken up by “Sorry I can’t find that one”, I checked Spotify and the song was still there. When I requested the song using voice control I got the same response. I tried putting the song alone in a playlist and putting the name of the playlist in the morning routine, that worked for a few days. Now, instead of playing the specific song/playlist I’ve set up in the routine it’s just playing whatever I last had on Spotify. I’ve tried disconnecting and reconnecting my Spotify account which hasn’t had any effect. What else can I try to make this work again?

I own several Echo devices: 2 Echo dots 3rd gen, 1 Echo Dot 4th gen and one Echo 4th generation (the big boy).

The Echo 4 seem to have some bluetooth issues, that do not occur with the other devices I own:

When I connect my smartphone (Galaxy S10 if that matters) to the Echo 4  and play certain songs, I notice a crackling sound during the quieter parts. One example is the song ""One"" by Metallica. During the slow intro their are guitar sounds that cause the crackling sounds, for example.

If I disconnect bluetooth and play the song on the Echo 4 directly (""Alexa, play One by Metallica""), the problem doesn't occur!

I tried this with my Echo Dot 3rd gen, the problem doesn't occur!

Also I noticed a percievable sound delay when playing songs (in videos it's mostly noticable) on the Echo 4.

Could you guys do me a favor and try this on your Echo 4? Here's the song, if you don't want to search for it:

We have 3 Echos in the house which we rely on for doorbell chimes for our Ring Doorbell Camera.

amazonecho,kenwiens,Alexa drops digits in simple math questions,"Alexa bug in simple math question?

Interesting calculation interpretation here: I want to know the answer to 3,493.1 - 3,445.6.  So I ask:

""Alexa, What's three thousand four hundred ninety three point one minus three thousand four hundred forty five point six""

Alexa responds with ""3,493.1 - 0.6 = 3,492.5""

It seems to have lost all digits before the decimal point in the second number.

I try this with a few minor changes to the second number and Alexa still misses everything before the decimal point in the seconds number.  However, if I change the second number dramatically to say ""9,876.5"" it seems to get both numbers (and the answer) correct.   I've tried this on multiple Alexa's and always get the same error. I've had different people ask this of Alexa and it continues to fail.  If you replace the word ""minus"" with ""subtract"" it gets it right.  If you replace ""minus"" with ""plus"" it gets it right.

&amp;#x200B;

If you drop off the decimal point from either number, then Alexa gets it right (eg 3493 - 3445.6 or 3493.1 - 3445).

The only way to get the correct answer from Alexa is to replace the word ""minus"" with the word ""subtract""

I also tried to say it to my Alexa Show.  It displayed it incorrectly there too (""3,493.1 - 0.6 = 3,492.5"")

amazonecho,zanhoria,Echo Show 5 (and others i assume) requires user to also have a smartphone ... not mentioned anywhere.," Echo Show requires a smartphone to set it up for voice/video calls, because that's done only through the Alexa app, which is only available for mobile, not desktop. This I discovered after buying 2, one for me and one for my elderly Mom to use for video calling. We (her kids) are all buying them so she, who has been in lockdown in her senior apartments since March, can see her kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. Mom is not computer savvy whatsoever and does not have a smartphone, which is why she can't use FaceTime or Hangouts or whatever. We thought this would be the perfect solution and were fine buying extra hardware just for this purpose.

So the fact that Mom is supposed to have a smartphone to run the Alexa app to set this up is not mentioned anywhere in the Echo Show promotional and product pix/text on Amazon's page. So so so aggravating.

I have mostly gotten around it by logging out of my Alexa app on my phone and logging in as her (she does have an Amazon account, which I set up too). Still it was a frustrating 2 hrs yesterday afternoon trying to set both up and test the video calling so I could bring hers over as a fait accompli (only need to switch network to her building's wifi). I haven't done that yet, wish me luck. 

One crucial thing during setup was that even logged in as her on the Alexa app, the setup insisted it needed her phone number to send an SMS to, and she needed to report the verification code in the SMS.  Luckily she has a senior phone that can receive SMS's (which she never uses), so I stepped her through finding it and telling me the code they needed. 

I'll be putting this in my review on Amazon (fat lot of good that'll do), but does anyone here use the Echo Show for video calling an elderly, non-computer-using relative? Did you discover any secrets or workarounds? My next task is how to set it up so can say ""Alexa, call Zanhoria"" and it'd call my Echo and not my phone. I don't think that's possible. She'll have to say ""Alexa, call Zanhoria's Echo Show device"" per my testing. sigh.",2020-11-04 19:12:32,1,"Echo Show 5 (and others i assume) requires user to also have a smartphone ... not mentioned anywhere. |  Echo Show requires a smartphone to set it up for voice/video calls, because that's done only through the Alexa app, which is only available for mobile, not desktop.

amazonecho,gvXVI,Echo Studio paired via Bluetooth to Sony TV,"Hey y’all,


So I bought a Sony x900h TV and an Echo Studio to pair with it (Prime Day ftw). Today I connected the Studio to the TV via Bluetooth, but the volume was terribly low. I checked and it was maximum volume on both tv+speaker but the volume was nowhere near what I expected. The TV at 100 is loud, and the Studio when playing music at max volume shakes the house. But both of them paired literally sounds like the tv at 40 volume.

amazonecho,DPAmes1,Stupid Echo bug with default group speaker,"I have two identical Echo Dots. With one I can say ""Alexa, connect Bluetooth"" or ""Alexa, pair"", and it works.

When I attempt to voice control ""Alexa turn on master bedroom lights"" I get reply ""you have multiple items"" 

I delete the master bedroom 2 but it just shows up few days later.


Thanks in advance",echo keep adding same hue light | hey team hoping it a quick fix but i have 2 master bedroom hue light left and right nightstand that alexa somehow keep adding twice light group is called master bedroom and echo add master bedroom 2 when i attempt to voice control alexa turn on master bedroom light i get reply you have multiple item i delete the master bedroom 2 but it just show up few day later thanks in advance,80

amazonecho,daniel9x,Lutron Caseta Fan Control - No longer able to control Fan Speeds via Alexa,"I’ve had 3 of these controls for almost a year and they worked fine. Mostly only used Alexa for our master fan but I’m pretty sure the other two worked as well. 

Recently I added a 4th one to a different room (with a different Echo Dot and a group/room). I was trying to be cute and named the fan (via the Alexa app) “fan” thinking the echo would be smart enough to know which one based on the room I’m in, similar to the lights.

Unfortunately this seems to have broken everything in ALL the rooms and I’ve tried (almost) everything. Now ALL fan controls can only turn off/on via Alexa and any attempt to adjust the speed results in a “[fan name] doesn’t support that”. I’ve tried removing ALL the fan switches from the app and even the Lutron app and manually putting them back one at a time and it’s the same behavior. This DID work and I understand maybe there’s some naming conflict that’s confusing Alexa but I’ve removed them all and added them with separate names.

Short of doing a complete Alexa/Lutron reset (which would be a huge hassle and not even sure would work), any idea on what else I could try? Any tips would be appreciated.

I should point out it works with HomeKit (“Hey Siri”)",2020-11-02 00:39:30,1,"Lutron Caseta Fan Control - No longer able to control Fan Speeds via Alexa | I’ve had 3 of these controls for almost a year and they worked fine.

amazonecho,poutypatrol,Help! NPR has taken over my flash briefing,"All of a sudden NPR has taken over my flash briefings. 

NOTE: This is not to hate on NPR. I just don't want to start my days with Korva Coleman narrating our doom right now. And it's damn right rude to take over my flash briefing.

I do not have NPR in my flash briefing, but all of a sudden it has taken over and my flash briefing now consists of only NPR, not the briefings I have chosen.

Note that this is only when using the flash briefing in a routine. When a routine has as a part of it to play the flash briefing, it's only NPR. When I ask for my flash briefing directly, Alexa does the right thing.

There are two NPR skills in my account, which I can not get rid of no matter what. (See screenshot.) When I remove the one called ""NPR"" it comes back a few minutes later like the undead. The other one called ""NPR News"" can't be removed. Clicking on it take me to a screen that says it doesn't exist.

Has anybody else had their mornings hijacked like this? Any solutions? Contact Amazon?

amazonecho,DPAmes1,Some notes on using multiple Echo units connected to different country accounts,"In Canada it's common to have both an amazon.ca account and an amazon.com account, to allow cross-border shopping and to take advantage of some Amazon services and features only available in the U.S.. I imagine this is common with other countries as well. This extends to setting up Amazon Echo units in the home - certain features are only available with amazon.com accounts, sometimes for years before they become available in other countries. For example Alexa Guard, or using a Fire tablet in Echo Show mode.  
However some features may only be available in your home country Amazon account, for example if you have Amazon Prime for local shopping, and you have signed up for discounted Amazon Music Unlimited. So the question arises, can you mix use of the two Amazon accounts with your Echo units? I've had some experience with this recently, so I thought I might document them here for the benefit of other users with multiple country accounts.  
The short answer is No. Each Echo unit must be assigned to one Amazon account from one country. It does not have to be your home country, so assignment to an amazon.com account is permitted, but in that case you cannot access any features of your home country account.  
Guest Access is not supported between countries. Family sharing is not supported between countries. So there is no way to access the services of your home country account on an amazon.com Echo, or vice-versa.  
Multiple Echo units in the same home can be registered to different Amazon country accounts. Each one must be set up independently, but nothing prevents the simultaneous sharing of home automation devices between different country accounts with most skills. For example any individual WiFi light/switch/plug in the home can be operated from either an amazon.com account or another country account interchangeably if it is set up in both.  
Devices and groups/rooms must be within a Home as Amazon defines it. An individual account can have more than one Home, but devices in that account must only be in one Home. However, devices in any Home associated with the account can be remotely voice controlled regardless of which Home the Echo unit is in. A Home and its contents can only be in one Amazon account, so if you want to access those devices in another account, you must replicate the Home and its devices in the other account.  
Streaming music service subscriptions vary: of course Amazon Music Unlimited can only be associated with one Amazon account, but other independent services like Spotify, Deezer, or Apple Music can appear in multiple Amazon accounts without problems.",2020-10-28 21:04:48,1,"Some notes on using multiple Echo units connected to different country accounts | In Canada it's common to have both an amazon.ca account and an amazon.com account, to allow cross-border shopping and to take advantage of some Amazon services and features only available in the U.S..

This started yesterday morning. If I ask Alexa, on my Echo Dot, to play a particular song on Spotify she starts playing the last played song and doesn't even start at the beginning.

My basement group still works. That group has no dimmers on it so I am assuming that is part of the change.

amazonecho,schmeebis,Options for simple on/off of LIFX light?,"Hi Echo community.

I am a renter so I can't do any electrical work on my flat. I have a LIFX bulb at my front door. I have a light switch for it at the top of my stairs that I leave always on to power the LIFX bulb. I have a couple of nice Routines setup so the light turns on/off with motion / Ring events from my Ring 3. 

Here's an enhancement I'd like to do: I want to stick an adhesive or screw-in battery powered simple switch that can turn my LIFX on/off right onto the wall. So that we can still turn the light on/off on demand like normal humans and not have to get our phones out or yell to our Echo.

I figured there would be a lot of options but it looks like Flic and Ikea Tradfri are the only 2 players in this space? I figured with the Amazon Dash button years ago there would be a million Chinese ""battery powered wifi push button"" solutions by now, but it looks like I'm wrong? Did I miss a whole phase of the Smart Home movement or am I googling the wrong search terms?

amazonecho,benzimm86,Echo and Ring notifications,"We have a Ring security system and doorbell which is connected into our echo devices.  The question I have is, are you able to independently control which echo devices are connected to the Ring system?  When our doorbell detects motion, all the echo devices will say ""motion detected in the front yard"".  This is great but it would be better if we could have it only broadcast on certain echo devices.  We do not want to add more echo devices in our home because we do not want these broadcasts being played at all hours of the day/night.

amazonecho,steveb68,"Echo Spatial Perception not working in my House, HELP!","So... this has been driving me crazy for probably over a year now. Anyone else having the same problem? I've got like 6-7 Echo units in my house. **They all hear my voice when I give a give the wake word and beep back at me**. Crazy making! I wrote this query into the ""Amazon tech world"" about 5 minutes ago. Found another posting on the same thing there and here(but it was over a year ago and closed out). As I have NOT found a solution elsewhere, I'm hoping someone in the RedditSphere will answer faster than Amazon (I also trust you guys more than them!). Here is my posting to them. I was responding to the solution presented by the Amazon moderator which said, ""update the firmware and power reset them all."" **SO... ANY IDEAS? Or better yet, solutions?!**

Here is my posting to them ---&gt;&gt; OK. **""Jen/Amazon Staff""** pretty much just said ""power off and back on again"". I know she used more words but that is the essence. In the IT world that is pretty much like your Doctor telling you to ""take 2 aspirin and call me in the morning."" It's not a solution to this and a seasoned tech support person would know that. **This won't fix this problem!** At least, not for me. I have 7 Echo devices in my house (and that is NOT counting the 4 tablets and 2 cell phones who could be answering) and sometimes 3 or 4 all go ""beep"" and try to respond to my voice. The units may be as far as 50 feet away from each other! **This started happening over a year ago.** I have a gen1 Echo, 2 gen2 Dot's, 3 gen 3 Dot's, and an Echo Show 5. Can someone really provide some help on this issue of why **""Echo Spatial Perception"" no longer works**? It was great... **when it worked.** It stopped working properly at least a year ago. I have tried to ignore it but it's driving me crazy so I'm really hunting for someone who can help solve the problem! It is really frustrating hearing all the Echo's going ""Bing, Bing, Bing..."" down the hallway when I say the wake word. Sure, I could try changing the wake word, but that puts the burden of work on me and it is a klugey solution when ESP is supposed to take care of this problem. I've done many searches in the GoogleSphere with different query phrases and am feeling a little spooked that I've seen so little talk about this. I'm assuming it is happening to lots of people. Maybe many of them are new and are not aware that ESP should be shielding them from the dreaded ""Bing, Bing, Bing""? Or mebbe an **elite cadre of Amazon Ninja's** are taking out all the people who complain? Seriously, ""Help Me, Obi-Wan! You're my only hope..."" Is there someone in the Amazon staff world that has a solution? Help. Please! **kcschiebel** listed above was the most recent link towards a solution, yet we don't know if his problem was solved...
