googlehome,eeeerrrppp,I’m stumped: Ideal noise machine?,"I have a second google home mini I want to use as a noise machine by my door, for my privacy and that of the rest of the house, and mostly so I’m not distracted. But I want to be able to start this noise on my main smart speaker, by my desk, and without it using a service that either has ads or will prevent me from using that service on another device.

I know you can say “okay google, play white noise” and it will do that...but on whatever speaker is picking you up. I want it to play on the door speaker no matter what.

After looking closer, it looks like google assistant uses “Relaxing Sounds” as a stand in for the streaming service when you play white noise or any sleep sounds. So, eventually I made a routine triggered by “hey google, noise” that ran the custom command “play white noise of relaxing sounds on door speaker.”

For about 10 minutes, this worked! I had my noise on the right speaker and I could still listen to Spotify on my phone! But then it stopped playing noise and instead played violin music on Spotify, which both failed to block the noise outside my door and overran my listening on my phone. 

Presumably, some modifier involving “repeat” or “loop” ought to fix this, but every combination I tried either made the command unrecognizable or resulted in the door speaker playing from Spotify.

So, and idea what kind of command I could use to achieve my goal here? I know there is no physical limitation preventing this—I could plug in a noise machine to a smart outlet and get this effect if I wanted—but something about how google’s built in sounds seems to prevent it. Any ideas are appreciated!",2021-04-19 02:46:28,1,"I’m stumped: Ideal noise machine? | I have a second google home mini I want to use as a noise machine by my door, for my privacy and that of the rest of the house, and mostly so I’m not distracted.

googlehome,m4ttjirM,Audio is all of a sudden being broadcast on Google TV?,"I have multiple Google mini speakers throughout the house, and 3 Google TV with chromecast. Everything has been working for months when it comes to my system, and broadcasting messages throughout the home and to specific rooms like an intercom.

Yesterday I went to broadcast a message and all of a sudden my TV turns on and broadcasts my audio through the Google TV in addition to all my Google mini speakers. The TV had a gray background and it said broadcast or something along those lines.

Not sure what changed or how to stop this? I don't remember setting this up and I can't find anything about the messages broadcasting to the TV. The TV is also not part of the same group as the mini speakers.

Couldn't find any broadcast specific settings, or any pertinent settings in the Google TV settings in Google home.

Pull up the foreign and she revved to go
99 problems but the money never was it

googlehome,pomokey,Nest audio setup trouble,"Bought a new nest audio, since they are on sale.  Could not get it to finish setting up. It would joint my wifi network (and I could see it on my network) but google home said it couldn't connect, stating ""your nest audio was setup but cant be found"" and mentioning AP isolation, which I know is turned off.  

The speaker would exit setup mode, but if I tried to ask it anything, it would just say  ""please login through the google home app"".  Tried factory resetting 3 times, and using a different phone, reset my router, etc.

Finally saw a post mentioning the nest mini having trouble with 2.4 ghz and 5 ghz wifi networks that share the same SSID.

So I temporarily disabled my 5 ghz wifi, and it completed the setup without issue. I have since turned the 5 ghz back on, and I can see the nest audio is currently connected to that, and seems to be working fine.

I thought maybe it was region locked because I live in a slightly obscure place but my brother managed to connect just fine. He’s on a Samsung and I’m on an iphone, idk if that has any impact.

googlehome,BigfootTundra,"Looking to Homify and Nestify my house, looking for recommendations!","Looking to join the Google Home gang (become a Google Homie? ...ok i'll leave) and just wondering what would be a good set up. I'm getting the Nest Hello and wiring it with an indoor power adapter  since there is no hard-wired doorbell in the house. This means there is no chime so I'll be relying on my phone and other Google Home devices to tell me when someone's at the door. 

I was planning to get a Google Home Max for my living room/entertainment ara and then a few Google Home Minis to put in my bedroom, the office, etc. I was also planning to get a sound bar for my living room to hook up to my TV, but feel like it might be overkill to have a Max and a sound bar. 

I guess there are three options:

* Use the Google Home Max as a soundbar
* Buy a Max and a sound bar and just have both
* Skip the Max and get an extra mini for the living room and buy a sound  bar

What would you recommend and/or what is your set up?

googlehome,Sasquatch6987,General solutions for Google smart device issues.,"I've been noticing and replying to a lot of complaints about people's Google Home Mini's, Audios, Nests, etc. So, in response to that, and in hopes that a Google search will net this for anyone else who has any of these issues in the future, I'm going to compile all the information that I have, and I ask that anyone else who has anything to share, please add to the conversation below.

A lot of problems can be solved by examining your setup and physically moving devices around a little bit. Having trouble with the device hearing you? Try moving the thing out from under stuff like TV's, desks, or anything else that could muffle sounds. Echo could possibly be a thing(unlikely, considering today's technology), so move some extra furniture or a rug into a room that echos.

Two words: surge protector. Buy some. You should have them on everything that's worth some money or that you don't want to explode during a lightning storm. A lot of problems for a whole bunch of different electronics can be solved by simply adding a surge protector to a circuit. Older homes, homes located at the end of a tap, and homes in areas where there is a lot of fluctuations in grid power can suffer from electrical hums coming through the wall outlet. That can cause feedback in microphones that would essentially deafen any smart device. All of that being said, if you have cable or satellite television, I don't suggest running coaxial through it, as that can mess with the signal and give you a shit picture. DO NOT buy a cheap surge protector; this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations, so buy something that has a good reputation and good reviews from actual paying human customers. I suggest TP-LINK by KASA; I've been using their products for a few months and I haven't had any issues, and since you have a digital assistant that's capable of such things, you can voice control the outlets(which is cool as hell, trust me). No, I'm not sponsored.

If your device having issues connecting to your WiFi, or keeps getting disconnected from your network; it's time to examine your wireless router. Older or cheaper wireless routers can have a cap on the number of connections they can maintain at one time. That's fine if you only have, say, a laptop and a cellphone. But, if you're like me, you have five phones, three laptops, two smart TV's, two gaming consoles, four tablets, five smart speakers, a Nest thermostat and a half dozen other wireless devices devices that are constantly connected to the internet at one time; then it's time to consider an upgrade. Check the capabilities of a device before you buy it, and check those ratings and reviews! Again: you get what you pay for! I personally use two Google WiFi routers in a mesh setup so I can stay in the Google ecosystem. Still not sponsored.

Next up is the ""my assistant doesn't understand me anymore"" or ""my assistant understands me, but nobody else"" issues. First, try retraining your voice with Google Assistant. Have everyone that's in your household do the same. Once you've tried that, and if you're still having the same problem, factory reset the problematic devices and log into your accounts again. Make sure the firmware updates and you have the latest version installed on every smart device. That should fix the problem, it did for me.

Lastly, just think about general home construction and cleanliness. If you live in a mobile home, apartment or stick-built home that has a lot of metal, that could mess you up. Cleanliness is a thing. I'm not judging, I recently had a nasty living situation myself; it happens. Cockroaches, bedbugs, mice and all sorts of other critters like to hide in and around electronic devices because it's warm and relatively safe shelter. Those creatures will create beds and nests, which can cause issues with electronic devices. Roach feces can and will clog up microphones. Wipe down anything that you're having problems with, just don't wash them in water(duh).

That's all I can think of right now, I'll add more as it comes to mind. I'm not a doctor, my financial advice isn't backed up by the USDA, and I eat lead paint chips.

I also did a sort of reverse test today: I left for about an hour with lights on and speakers playing.  They were still all on when I got back.

Is there a way to adjust the sensitivity?  Is there a way to seeing more specifically what's triggering the mode change?  Was there some sort of update a month ago that might have caused the change in behavior?

googlehome,Rejvadin,Better integration of my Samsung TV?,"I'm not sure if this has been asked already, but I'm gonna try.

I have a Samsung TV linked to my google home via Smartthings. But the TV behaves like a switch (I can only turn it on and off). After a lot of painful googling, I have found out it's because Samsung TVs made prior to 2018 have terrible integration with google home, apparently. But, when I look at the TV in the Smartthings app, I can change volume, channels and more just like my remote can. 

Q: Is there any workaround (like smartthings hub or something else idk) that would allow me to use google home to control my tv completely just like my remote/smartthings app can (""increase the volume"" and so on)",2021-04-14 13:52:14,1,"Better integration of my Samsung TV? | I'm not sure if this has been asked already, but I'm gonna try.

Right now we just have a Nest Thermostat that came with the apartment, a mini and two smart light bulbs in the bedroom.

We want to replace our bedroom TV with something that google home can turn on and off if possible. Right now we just have an old TV with a Roku. We love the Roku because it has the Xfinity app so we don't need a cable box. We're not looking to spend a lot on this.

We need two air conditioners and we don't currently own any. We need one for the bedroom (250 ish sq ft) and one for the open living/dining area that's like 800sq ft. We're willing to spend more here for a better product. I'd mostly like it to go into an away mode when we leave and be able to turn it on and off from not near it.

You used to be able to get to active timers and alarms through the Google Home app, at device, information, timers. As of a recent update, this not longer works (app or Google Home... not sure).

The new method is to tap your user icon in the upper right, assistant settings, Devices, and select the device from there. This will show you the settings from before, including active timers and alarms.

I've heard that the intent is to split some of these settings up by user, so maybe this is why they've moved under Google Assistant settings, instead of just the device itself. I'm still seeing all timers for the device, regardless of who set them, though, so maybe a work in progress...?

googlehome,ms_monquis,"""Smart devices” not reconnecting after disconnection.","This may not be a Google Home question exactly, but I’m betting some of you have had the same experience, and I'd like to leverage that!

I have frequent power outages, sometimes for hours, sometimes for a fraction of a second. (The utilities have been working on it, and believe it or not, it’s improved.) Just now, the power blipped off so quickly/briefly that when it came back, my computer was exactly where I’d left off. But the modem and router went offline and had to fully reboot.

Some, but only SOME, of my wifi plugs and strips won't rejoin Google Home when power is returned, although I think it's losing the network that does it, rather than the power. Some of them seem to have the same manufacturer. I have a LOT of wifi plugs around the place, and it's a big PITA to have to go and re-add them.

Little more background: I currently use the TuyaSmart app on my iPhone to manage plugs, strips, and some bulbs. For instance, the 4-plug strip that's on my workbench. When power cycles, that strip will turn on one outlet (the second one, if that somehow matters) and the whole strip will show as ""Offline"" in the Google Home app. When I open TuyaSmart, that strip will initially be greyed out (offline) but quickly comes back and is controllable via the app. But Google Home still considers it offline.

I will have to manually re-add that strip in TuyaSmart before Google Home will see it again. I have to do this with 3-4 strips and a couple of singles around my house — usually the same offenders — and I don't know why.

Any ideas? Maybe not something I can FIX exactly because it could just be the rando, usually cheap amazon wifi power strip specials I tend to get, but it really does seem like a couple of them have the same manufacturer and they behave differently.

googlehome,emul0c,Remove single Hue device from GH,"Hi,

Anyone who knows how to remove a single Hue device from Google Home, if possible at all?

I have a Philips Hue smart plug that I intend to sit in front of my Raspberry Pi running Home Assistent, so that I can do remote reboots if I need to. 

I have Hue running separately and integrated into Google Home which works really well. However if I ask Google to turn of all lights, it also turns off my smart-plug which I don’t want it to. 
I have read up on previous posts, that regardless of what you call the plug or room, Google Home will always treat the smart plug from Hue as a light, and thus turn it off when you tell it to turn off all lights.

Therefore I was thinking if it is possible to remove just this single device completely from Google Home (I still want all other Hue devices integrated); because that would solve my problem.

\*android user\*

I need your help! Last night, we had a hickup in our glasfiber internet connection. So this morning I reset the modem (first point of internet entry in the house) and the internet was up and running again, so no issues there. 

Except our lights which we control via the google home app/routines. They were no longer reconised by the google app.

I've decided to relink the Philips Hue app, but this is where the first strange thing happened. The loading circle started to lag mid spin, So that was very weird, and something I've never seen before. 

After a few tries, I decided to unlink the Hue app and reconnect it. At first the same lag, and what seemed as an incomplete action. After a few tries, just reclicking the button, it disconnected the hue app and it was gone.

So I tried to reconnect as if it was a new product; there the shit continued. I kept getting the error message from the picture.

In summery of the next 3 hours:

* factory reset of the Hue Bridge
* deleted my Hue account
* reset the Google Home app
* reset the Philips Hue app
* Asked google to synch my devices (it only recognized my oppo smart plug)
* cleared the cache from the google home app (even after reinstalling)

I'm lost now. Google did not provide me with an awnser. HELP!

i recently bought some smart plugs in the hopes of getting google to turn on my lights for me, because i'm a lazy shit, but i've run into a problem (and for once it's not the smart plugs. little bastards). 

the problem is this: the lights i have in the smart plug are usb powered, and they have 8 different modes. the only mode i use is the last one, number 8, solid light setting. now, when i turn them on with google, they obviously go to the first mode, which flashes like crazy and drives me nuts looking at it. 

there's a button on the usb connector that switches between modes, but i have to go climb behind the couch to get to it and press it 8 times to get to the solid light setting. obviously this defeats the whole purpose of getting smart plugs in the first place, and i'd prefer not to have to go buy yet another set of lights, so does anybody know how to get google to flip through the light modes? or how to fuck with the circuit board (safely) so i can bypass the other modes? 

any suggestions are appreciated!!! if it's hopeless i'll buy another set, i'm just annoyed i didn't think about this when i got the plugs.",2021-04-09 00:22:28,1,"using google assistant on my 8-mode lights | question for yall!!

I've got a similar issue with Xiaomi Wifi LED bulb with both white and RGB colors (RGB+CCT / RGBWW).

Unfortunately Google Home recognises these bulbs as RGB only and when I want it to set color to ""warm white"" it uses only RGB channels to create it (not white LEDs) and it looks terrible.

If you've got the [Tile app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tile-find-lost-keys-phone/id664939913) installed on your iPhone, you can [link Tile to your Google Assistant](https://tileteam.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011083948-Google-Nest-Devices-with-Tile#:~:text=Yes%2C%20both%20smartphones%20and%20third,to%20ring%20your%20nearby%20Tile) and have it ring your phone –– even when the phone is on silent mode. This doesn't require you to own a Tile, either, just download the iOS app and create an account.

Once Tile is linked to Google Home, you can ring your phone by saying ""Hey Google, ask Tile to find my phone"" – I set up a routine to be able to trigger it by just saying ""Hey Google, find my phone"".

googlehome,sirmrfabio,My first Google Home routine,"Hello,
I just configured my first Google Home setup. Very satisfied by the Google Assistant, but having problems with a very simple routine:

How to start
-) I scheduled a time (workdays)
-) had to add a vocal command which is mandatory (so stupid cause I scheduled it, so the logic is unknown to the final user)

This routine will
-) weather 
-) play news

The feedback for playing news is “sorry, I didn’t understand” 🙈

Second try: I changed Play news with play a news podcast latest episode and the audio has been directed to the Nest Hub in the kitchen, despite I configured the routine to start in the bedroom where my speaker is.
The speaker is Google Home mini...

Do you have any hints? (It’a a new setup and all devices already got a factory reset)

googlehome,Sketch3000,Can someone please help me understand volume control when using a group?,"Volume control when using groups has been my most recent maddening experience with google home.

It used to be (a while ago) that when using a group to stream music, asking google to adjust the volume would only change volume on the device being spoken to.  The group could be adjusted by asking google to change the volume on “group”.

Example.  “Turn the volume down” would lower the volume on that specific device.

“Turn the volume on house down” would Lower the volume on the group called house.

Now it seems it’s the opposite.  If im using a group and want the volume in one room to be different, I have to specify the change by device “hey google, turn the volume on kitchen down”

And “turn the volume up” as a generic phrase will adjust the entire group.


Today, even though I saw the command register as a device specific volume command, it still adjusted all the devices in the group.

I almost never want to adjust the group as a whole, and as of late, I’m finding it more and more difficult to change the volume on a single device (with voice command).

googlehome,GuyInDogSuit,Having a hell of a time fixing this &amp;$¥€©% thing,"A few days ago, some of my lights, plugged into smart outlets, stopped responding. I couldn't get them to turn off or on via my phone or my Hub.

I tried clearing my app data. No go.

So then I got the bright idea to delete my home entirely. Didn't work, either. Then I realized they had another app of their own I had forgotten I had installed, so I went into that, removed all three, and set them up again. So now those work.

But the one ""smart"" bulb I have installed, can't be re-added, and I can't seem to add my Hub 2 to the speaker group (my gen1 Hub and Home mini show up, though). The bulb is one of those ""C by GE"" ones, and I tried resetting it by following the video tutorial. Neither ""wax on/wax off"" method worked (basically entails turning it off and on repeatedly, counting up to 8 seconds each time). I dunno if it's on an older firmware, or a 2.8+ one, but I didn't get the ""3 blinks"" reaction it was supposed to elicit, either way.

So, the short of it is, even with the C by GE app, I can no longer control that light bulb or even add it, and no matter how many times I create and delete a speaker group, I can't add my gen2 Hub to it.

googlehome,plasticinema,[WORKAROUND] Google Chromecast w/ speaker group audio output,"So I think I have this working again. Chromecast playing videos (Youtube, Dailymotion, other websites, ahem...) with the audio outputting to a speaker group in the same room (Home Max, Nest Audio, and Chromecast Audio connected to a radio) and it works pretty well.

The only catch: it seems like the feature is app-dependent so I tried a few things:

Youtube: not working
BBC iPlayer: not working
Dailymotion: not working
Chrome: working!
Web Video Cast: working!

So that's how it works. Your app needs to be casting the raw video to the Chromecast and then you can set the audio output to the speaker group. As well as this, once they're all outputting audio, I now see 'Kitchen TV +1' in my cast dialog.

So... not a cancelled feature but one still being working on?!

I'm looking to possibly switch from Droid (Samsung) to iPhone, but I've got a bunch of lights and speakers set up thru Google home. (only looking to use Apple for phone, everything else I have is pc and staying that way).

Is the practical user experience for Google home different from Droid to iPhone? Any pitfalls I should be aware of prior to making a potential switch?

googlehome,Inevitable-tcan,Google silencing complaints?,"So i’ve recently encountered a problem with my Google Home devices. I have to ask Them for everything twice! Now here’s an essay that describes how that makes me feel. 

“Hey google, turn off the lights”

*google confirms and does what i asked.

This I constant, for basically everything. On my smart screens I have to press lights or other smart home utility twice aswell?!?  

So naturally I decide to go to the internet to find answers and what do I find you might ask? 

Well I’m not the only one let’s just leave it at that, even worse is that many of these posts on Reddit and other sites are several years old so I can conclude it is not the first time that someone is going through this.

I’m getting desperate and I turn to googles own support. Every single mention of this (for yeas) has been “silenced” and not a single useful answer is to be found? All of the posts are closed down as soon as it gains a bit of traction? Why is this? 

I don’t mind google spying on me 24/7 but at least provide decent support for the devices while doing so?! They have known about this for years and the only sliver of an answer I could find was:

“It is either hardware, software, or connection problems” well gosh darn it google you don’t say? 
If my car does not drive and I go to the mechanic I don’t eat to hear “well it something to do with the car” 
They are literally saying NOTHING and then closing the case (which they have done countless time son me before to be honest) (once had a 3 hr call with support ending in “I will get back to you tomorrow with my manager” only to never be hard from again)

googlehome,Fiksdal,Will casting music to a speaker group consume more Internet data than casting to a single speaker?,"Here's my setup:

My internet at home comes from a 4G modem. because that's the best deal in my area in terms of price/speed. However, my speed is reduced to 3 Mbps after using 150 GB per month, but that's usually fine as I usually stay below 150. It does happen that i have to endure slow speeds for a few days during the last days of the month, though.

I use a Google Nest Wifi with one router connected by Ethernet to the 4g modem, and one more Google wifi (also acts as speaker) to enhance the signal.

I also have 6 Google speakers in various rooms throughout the apartment (3 Nest Audios, 1 Home Max, 1 Home Mini, and 1 original Home.)

I have made those 7 speakers into one group, and quite often I use Spotify to play on the entire group so they music plays in sync in the entire apartment.

Now, my question is: Will this consume more Internet data than simply casting to one speaker? For example, let's say I stream an album that would usually require 100 MB of data. I would assume that when this plays on all 7 speakers, this is only transferred once from the Internet, then transmitted on my local network to all the speakers.

Is that true though? After all, most people's data plans on home WiFi are unlimited, so it's not entirely unthinkable to me that Home was designed so that each speaker streams the music from the Internet. 

So while I assume the former, I would like to ask whether someone on this sub understands the inner workings of the Home/Nest system well enough to give me a concrete answer here.

Thanks in advance.",2021-04-01 13:52:20,1,"Will casting music to a speaker group consume more Internet data than casting to a single speaker? | Here's my setup:

My internet at home comes from a 4G modem. because that's the best deal in my area in terms of price/speed. However, my speed is reduced to 3 Mbps after using 150 GB per month, but that's usually fine as I usually stay below 150. It does happen that i have to endure slow speeds for a few days during the last days of the month, though.

I use a Google Nest Wifi with one router connected by Ethernet to the 4g modem, and one more Google wifi (also acts as speaker) to enhance the signal.

googlehome,opheaphea,Can't cast Spotify or Google Podcast app,"For about a week now I've been having issues casting the Google Podcast app to my nest hub. I can play podcasts by voice command and control the podcast after its playing (volume, play, pause) through the Google Home App, but when I try to cast through the podcast app, it comes up as no device connected.

googlehome,Moostache1029,Why is casting music from Spotify to my Home Mini so trash?,"Everytime I want to cast to my home Mini it'll work for one song and completely spaz out.

googlehome,MaineSky,Can you find individual phones/devices without Voice Match?,"We have a Nest mini, and a few 'smart' devices hooked into Google home.  My husband is the 'owner' I am added as a home member.  I have the Google Home and Nest app, everyone/thing is connected.

Husband does not want to turn on Voice Match, and does not want google recording our voices.  

Why can't I say something like 'Find John's phone' or 'Find Jane's phone' and have google understand, without voice match?   It is capable of identifying other individual devices by name- is there a different way to do this?  I tried setting up a IFTTT applet, which works through my own google assistant, but doesn't work through the Nest- I'm guessing bc the assistant in the Nest is specific to my husband.

First off, I am in Canada and I like to listen to CBC music. And I have a lenovo smart click in my bedroom.

The problem is that CKEW is CBC radio 1 and not CBC music. This routine used to work fine and it was only in the last week or so that this issue started.

googlehome,phantomenacer,Meross Switches,"Hi,

Was setting up some new switches at my parents house and ran into an issue with 2 of 3 of them. Maybe someone here can give me some troubleshooting pointers for when I go over next weekend.

So, last week I installed one switch (the 1 of 3 that is cooperating) giving the home a total of 10 lights. all good.

Today I installed 2 more switches and added them to rooms, but when I ask GH to turn on/off all lights it ignores the 2 newest ones. I can individually use GH to control them by name, i.e turn on the porch light without any issue. But for some reason it's not grouped into the whole house.

Are there Light names that are ""forbidden""?","I'm fairly new to Google's Smart Home integration and am overall actually fairly impressed but I've run into a weird issue I didn't see in the FAQ and it got me thinking: are there device names that are not allowed? 

I have several lights in a ""Room"" named *Backyard*. If one of these lights is named ""Firepit Light"" Assistant will not individually turn it off/on 99% of the time- but instead will just search the Internet for ""Turn off/on the firepit light"". 

Google will turn the light off/on with the entire Room when instructed regardless of the name of the Firepit light.

googlehome,GarfieldSighs3,Temp variance from nest thermostat to connected sensor,"Hi All -

I just purchased 2 Google Nest Learning Thermostats for our home (we have 2 zones with a thermostat downstairs and one upstairs). I’m having a couple issues mainly with the one upstairs. 

1) The downstairs nest thermostat is on the money with its temperature reading. I used 2 separate digital portable thermometers and sure enough, 68 is 68 (for example). The upstairs however reads 2 degrees higher then what it actually is. If it’s actually 68, it will read 70. I’ve noticed that consistency scales up and down. If the nest reads 68, it’s actually 66 and so on. Any way to resolve this? I’ve reset the nest several times and nothing seems to work. 

2) Adding to the upstairs temp being off by a few degrees...I bought a connected sensor to put in my daughters room. That room is literally 3 feet from the thermostat and there is no obvious temperature swing in that 3 feet. Similar to the above issue, the sensor reads 2 degrees lower than the thermostat. 69 means it’s 67 in her room 3 feet away. No chance it’s 2 degrees warmer 3 feet away in the hall where the thermostat is. 

Overall it seems like the culprit is the thermostat itself being off by 2 degrees. It’s not in direct sunlight and will never be during the day. I turned that feature off as I read that could have something to do with it. 

Any advice? It doesn’t seem like there is a real good way to recalibrate.",2021-03-16 19:05:52,1,"Temp variance from nest thermostat to connected sensor | Hi All -

googlehome,daedalusesq,Music vs video playback,"I’ve got YouTube premium and it comes with YouTube music. 

Sometimes it randomly decides that when I’m asking for music, I want a video for unknown reasons. A command that worked yesterday to play a specific song isn’t guaranteed to work today. 

I don’t have any video-capable devices in my Google home app. I didn’t ask for a video. 

Neither of the following commands get me what I want. 
“Play *song* by *artist*”
“Play *song* by *artist* on youtube music”

Both return a message along the lines of “You need to specify a device for video playback.”

In the YouTube music app, I’ve hit the switch to disable video playback in favor of audio only or album versions. It fixed the problem the first time it started doing this, but now it doesn’t seem to do anything, even when I toggle the setting off and back on. 

What else can I do to rectify the issue here? I will *never* be asking one of my devices for a video. Is there a way to just disable video functions completely?

googlehome,paralope,So much to learn!,"Trying to learn what I can to get the right devices to start up smart home. I have a few questions and I'm sure I will come up with many more. TIA

For the google nest Wi-Fi mesh does it broadcast the same Wi-Fi  as my ISP router or broadcast its own Wi-Fi  in addition to my isp's Wi-Fi? If it broadcasts its own, should I disable the default Wi-Fi on my ISP router, or use both throughout my home. 

Do the Wi-Fi access points contain any ethernet ports for wired devices? 

Are the speakers in the Wi-Fi and access points as good as the nest mini speaker for audio? Any downside to relying on a wifi access point as the smart speaker in a room.

I have read that anyone with my Wi-Fi password can access my Google home. Does the Google nest wi-fi system provide a guest login which allows people to use my internet but not my home functions? 

If my internet is down, but my Wi-Fi is still functioning, do all of the smart home devices in my house still work? Or do they require an internet connection. 

Does the nest thermostat have any speaker or requires another speaker to control it.

Can temperature sensors in a room be set to control devices that are not the thermostat. For example turn on the smart wall plug, where an electric heater may be plugged in.

Can I Chromecast a Netflix/YouTube show to multiple devices such as different TV screens and speakers simultaneously.",2021-03-16 06:16:27,1,"So much to learn! | Trying to learn what I can to get the right devices to start up smart home.

I have read that anyone with my Wi-Fi password can access my Google home. Does the Google nest wi-fi system provide a guest login which allows people to use my internet but not my home functions? 

If my internet is down, but my Wi-Fi is still functioning, do all of the smart home devices in my house still work? Or do they require an internet connection. 

Does the nest thermostat have any speaker or requires another speaker to control it.

Can temperature sensors in a room be set to control devices that are not the thermostat. For example turn on the smart wall plug, where an electric heater may be plugged in.

Can I Chromecast a Netflix/YouTube show to multiple devices such as different TV screens and speakers simultaneously.",so much to learn | trying to learn what i can to get the right device to start up smart home i have a few question and im sure i will come up with many more tia for the google nest wi fi mesh doe it broadcast the same wi fi a my isp router or broadcast it own wi fi in addition to my isps wi fi if it broadcast it own should i disable the default wi fi on my isp router or use both throughout my home do the wi fi access point contain any ethernet port for wired device are the speaker in the wi fi and access point a good a the nest mini speaker for audio any downside to relying on a wifi access point a the smart speaker in a room i have read that anyone with my wi fi password can access my google home doe the google nest wi fi system provide a guest login which allows people to use my internet but not my home function if my internet is down but my wi fi is still functioning do all of the smart home device in my house still work or do they require an internet connection doe the nest thermostat have any speaker or requires another speaker to control it can temperature sensor in a room be set to control device that are not the thermostat for example turn on the smart wall plug where an electric heater may be plugged in can i chromecast a netflix youtube show to multiple device such a different tv screen and speaker simultaneously,271

googlehome,87321,"I am programming my own voice assistant that uses home bridge to manipulate devices, I need to find a good speaker/mic can you help?","Maybe somebody can help me here - I have homebridge set up and have built my own personal assistant with VoiceAttack, So I basically can program my own automated assistant and use the Ivona Brian voice. It's pretty damn amazing. When wearing a headset and sitting at the PC, it can respond with all sorts of great quips and comebacks and even has conversational abilities. It really is the way to go for a TRUE home butler. 

\- He gives me a morning summary when the motion detector detects me in the morning. 

\- Updates me on processes that complete, like laundry, water heater, stove, fridge. 

\- Can control everything that is connected to homebridge. 

\- Can have a conversation, tell jokes, stories and so on. 

\- Endless customization with wake words, playing custom songs, and other neat things. 

I do have a question though, All of this stuff only works with my headset. One of the great things with I want a HomePod/Google Mini/Alexa is that they are small devices with a microphone and speaker built together. I need something like that that I can just hook up to my PC mic/speaker and mount on the ceiling. That way I have an input device that will ping the PC, and return the PC audio back out. 

I have been trying to get these all in one products to just work as a mic and speaker for my pc but they don't, some will as a speaker, but the mic is disabled. Is there anything you guys would recommend for a built in Mic and Speaker that also can pick up voice as well as these all in ones?

Also, for the Jarvis fans, I use Ivona and Brian's voice, which is very similar and when sped up a little, sounds just like Bettany.

googlehome,CommodoreLuna,How to hide my Youtube playlists / history from other users on the Nest Hub,"I have multiple google home speakers set up in my house, including a Nest hub. I never use them myself, but I've set them up around the house to allow others to stream their music more locally rather than blasting it across the house, and it's all been pretty intuitive so far.

The Nest hub is something I only set up a few months ago, so I'm mostly unfamiliar with the UI and features. My prior experience with playing music from home devices is either someone requests a specific song, or they request music and a streaming service (eg. Spotify), and the home device will play it based on the person's music history, which is fine since both cases are relevant to the person requesting the music.

The Nest hub on the other hand seems to play music indiscriminately. I wasn't sure if it would tailor music preferences based on facial recognition since it is not necessary to use voice commands, but it just seems to mix together a playlist based on the history of any accounts connected to it. Music that I've played on youtube, or songs of a similar nature show up in the ""up next"" playlist whenever anyone uses the hub to play music directly or on any other home device.

What ways are there to remove accidental access to music I have listened to? Ideally I would still like to be able to access the various home devices, just not the other way round. There seems to be no control over account access from the hub itself, but from my phone I can see the option to remove the hub from ""my home"" which I assume would solve the issue for the Nest hub, but I wouldn;t be able to cast video / pictures / audio from my phone to the Nest hub if I were to remove it",2021-03-13 23:40:21,1,"How to hide my Youtube playlists / history from other users on the Nest Hub | I have multiple google home speakers set up in my house, including a Nest hub.

googlehome,DasBauHans,Google TV remote setup for external tv speakers,"Just got my Google TV, and I already really like it. I have a fair amount of Google-based home automation set up already, and after buying a new Philips TV (old one died), and they replaced the fabolous Android TV OS with the buggy and crappy Saphi OS, my new Google TV fixed my broken TV world.

Set up was a breeze, as usual, the only thing I couldn’t figure out is how to use the remote to control volume of my external speakers. They’re connected with the optical audio out from the tv, so when Google TV setup asks if I have a soundbar or an AV receiver, I assume it’s more like a soundbar. The brand is not in the list to choose from, they are Argon ALTO A5 active speakers, bought from a local high-end hifi store (Hifiklubben.dk). 

I tried a number of generic options from the list in settings, but none of them worked. My tv is set up to only play sound through those speakers, so it’d be hazzle to have to use a second remote just for volume.

Any ideas on how to solve this?

Problem 1) Now I’ve moved out again to my own place with my own google assistant and mini, the speakers don’t show up on spotify. I have to play a song, pause then tell google to play spotify for it to work, and then the volume doesn’t work.

Problem 2) Spotify will play and listen to me via google home / mini, but it won’t let me use the controls. If I try to turn the volume up or down on my phone or laptop it won’t work. I would prefer this as it’s faster and doesn’t stop the music like asking google to do it does.

At my parents I could do everything fine and smoothly via my laptop or phone on spotify, but now for some reason it won’t let me?

Problem 1) Now I’ve moved out again to my own place with my own google assistant and mini, the speakers don’t show up on spotify. I have to play a song, pause then tell google to play spotify for it to work, and then the volume doesn’t work.

Problem 2) Spotify will play and listen to me via google home / mini, but it won’t let me use the controls. If I try to turn the volume up or down on my phone or laptop it won’t work. I would prefer this as it’s faster and doesn’t stop the music like asking google to do it does.

At my parents I could do everything fine and smoothly via my laptop or phone on spotify, but now for some reason it won’t let me? Also at my previous home (pre-parents) I didn’t have these problems, only here. I just want to be able to control everything and for my speakers to show before I ask google.

I’ve disconnected my whole home and re-added the network and speakers which worked briefly, but now it’s stopped working again. I am unable to unlink spotify as my default music player too.

My assistant also randomly goes into an american accent when there’s an issue? then back to UK..

In the living room I have: Google home mini, 2 Meross smart bulbs, 1 Gosund smart plug

Bedroom: Lenovo smart clock, 1 Gosund smart plug

Front porch: 1 Gosund smart bulb

Backyard: Google home mini, 1 Gosund smart bulb, 1 Gosund smart plug.


I have confirmed they are all in the same home and connected.

I noticed tonight that my Lenovo smart clock will not turn on my porch or backyard lights, but has no problem with the living room or the bedroom lights.

googlehome,HeyCharrrrlie,Considerations Before a Factory Reset?,"So my setup went all fucky and no matter what I do I can't seem to unfucky it. 

I have 1 nest hub max, two nest speakers, three mini nest speakers (not) controlling 13 smart bulbs, one smart plug and a Vizeo tv. 

The trouble started when I bought a light strip for the kitch n cabinets and installed the app on my Android phone. What I later discovered was it would seem that the same Chinese company under a different brand name makes the light strip I bought and the smart bulbs that I had previously installed. In fact, both apps can control either light type.

Trouble includes:
- Music either won't play on all speakers or cuts out. I unplugged everything, including the router but no joy. 
- Won't turn on/off lights. I deleted all rooms, no joy. I deleted all my routines, setup new ones, no joy.

googlehome,Zebitty,Nest hub not connecting incoming voice calls properly -HELP,"I have incoming calls set up on my various google home devices. Up until a few weeks ago, they were all working fine and would handle incoming calls properly.

The other devices (all google minis) still work fine and I can hear and speak normally when receiving incoming calls. Additionally, I can make outgoing calls on the nest hub and that works just fine. It's only incoming calls where I can't hear the caller and they can't hear me.

googlehome,3gaydads,Nest Home stereo pair - stereo image sliding around?,"2 days ago I got 2x Nest Home and set them up as a stereo pair in my living room. However, I've noticed the strangest slide-y smear-y effect on the stereo mix when playing music (which is pretty much all I use them for), like the centre of the image is being panned across both speakers.

It doesn't happen on all tracks, and it doesn't happen repeatably on the same tracks, but it happens when streaming YTM, BBC Sounds, and casting VLC from my phone. The fact it's happening across multiple services makes me think it's the devices/device software but I don't know how to pin it down. I've unlinked and relinked them but still get the same occasional effect.

Anyone else had this?

googlehome,qroft,Get inspired by several gaming and fun actions that I created.,"First of all: the actions that I created are in German.
But I put them in here in case that you would like me to develop them also in English. Just comment if you want me to and as soon as I find the time I create them ;)

For the Germans among you, here is a video about the actions.
https://youtu.be/4aI33pBXBFE

And here are the actions that I offer in there!

**Scissors, Paper, Stone (Game)**
You tell the user that you want to play a game of Scissors, Paper and Stone.
The Google Assistant says what he has and asks you what you had. Then the Assistant says if you won or not.

**Name generator for a Mafia/Pimp name**
I took ridiculous adjectives and words and after you tell the Google Assistant your name and family name. So in my case i tell him that my name is Carlos Pinto and  the Assistant says something like: in the Underworld you are known as ""Fishy Carlos"" but the police files mention you as ""Pinto the nose"".

**Name generator for an american native name**
Based on names like ""sitting bull"" or ""wild horse"", again i took a list of adjectives and nouns and let the assistant create a random combination of both to offer you an american native name like ""wet cloud"" or ""dirty flower"".

**Google reads tour mind**
The Assistant asks you to choose a random number between 1 and 100. Based on some calculations that the Google Assistant asks you to make, at the end the device knows your result. IT'S MAGIC!

Ok, so if you would love me to create one of those in english, tell me to do so :)

The germans or people that understand german among this group can start the action by saying

googlehome,Scribble365,What are Google doing with the home app?,"Perhaps it’s just Ireland where I am from but the home app on iOS hasn’t been updated in over 3 months. It also seems like half of the features the app had 2 years ago are no longer there.

You have to speak to it to gain access to routines. It doesn’t voluntarily give traffic information. The app is basically pointless as it’s only a necessity for setting up or resetting the speaker.

Are there any alternative 3rd party apps that can do this? Currently I have a pair of Max’s set up as a stereo pair.

Or are Google discontinuing this app in favour of something new? Rebrand as Nest perhaps?

My entire family uses the broadcast command all the time (no one likes to shout across the house like when I was a kid apparently). It's an everyday use at my house. My daughter lives in an apt above our garage and we even have one at her house (but she only uses it to ask for food).

One time he fell down in the middle of the night, but luckily he remembered how to use the broadcast command. I was able to run over there and help him.

googlehome,Malocchioo,Google Nest Hub Powered VIA POE Network Switch and POE Power Adapter,"Hey everyone, 

I recently took on a smart home project that will require a total of (12) Google Nest Hubs to be installed in place of a 30 year old Nutone Intercom system. The Nutone system ran off of a low voltage 24AWG cable that is a total of 3 pairs for a total of 6 conductors. 

The idea is to wall mount the Google Nest Hub into the custom fabricated metal cover plates.

The issue I'm having is with the POE adapter at the Google Nest Hub end. I purchased this:  


[https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07KX5TDDN/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o09\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B07KX5TDDN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)  


The only issue is it did not come with the proper diameter power connector, so i spliced the one on it and soldered on the correct tip. Upon powering up the Nest Hub via POE from a POE switch, the adapter i listed above gets warm to the touch. Should I be worried about burying the warm device in the wall cavity? The wire itself (probably about 50 feet in length in the walls) is not getting warm.

googlehome,coheedcollapse,Brainstorming the solution to Google Home Casting Issues on Asus (and maybe other) routers.,"After months of struggling with some really bad disconnects on a pair of Asus RT-AX92U routers, I've finally landed on a combination of things that work. The reason I titled this ""brainstorming"" is because I'm not exactly sure WHICH of the changes I made stabilized my connection, so maybe I can get some input and  help some other people having the same issue along the way.

First, the issue - casting any audio from my phone to more than one Google Home device was a nightmare. Cut outs, complete drops, desyncing with my phone - you name it.

I'll skip the fixes I've tried, because there have been many. Namely, a whole bevy of wireless settings, turning off any type of roaming on my Google Home devices between my two routers, downgrading firmware to 384 from 386 (as suggested by someone on a forum), and a whole bunch of other stuff.

What finally seems to have fixed the issue on my network are two things, specifically.

First, disable auto on wifi control channel. I'd switched to this a few months back thinking maybe my issue was interference from nearby homes. We're SATURATED with 2.4ghz wireless in my neighborhood. I disabled this, walked around my entire house with a Wifi diagnosis device, and came up with a channel that seems to be far enough away from the strongest interference.

Second, and this one is a bit more obscure and I'm not exactly sure WHY it works, but after switching it, I'm suddenly getting a better connection than I've had in months - change the modulation scheme (found in ""professional"" under wifi on my Asus router), from ""Up to MCS9"" to ""Up to MCS7"". From what I've read, MCS9 can cause issues in some devices, and I don't need raw speed on my 2.4ghz network anyway, because it's almost primarily for my smart home stuff.

That's it! That's all I've done, and I've gotten through two entire podcasts with no disconnects at all. Doesn't sound like much, but this is the first time in months I've had that joy.

Feel free to drop tips here if you've got them as well, I just wanted to share my experiences in case anyone else was desperate.",2021-03-08 22:56:36,1,"Brainstorming the solution to Google Home Casting Issues on Asus (and maybe other) routers. | After months of struggling with some really bad disconnects on a pair of Asus RT-AX92U routers, I've finally landed on a combination of things that work.

googlehome,slackmaster2k,Nest Mini Bluetooth to stereo - doesn't automatically reconnect after power reset,"I have one of my Minis paired to a Sony STR-DN840 stereo via Bluetooth.  I've set the stereo as the default speaker for the Mini (many times), and it works.  When I turn the stereo off, music output transfers back to the Mini, which is fine.

googlehome,pabloinfo1,TV + Chromecast + plug,"For a few weeks Google made a change when interpreting the command ""turn on the television.""

**Before**, when you had a Chromecast and a plug (assigned as a TV) in the same room, and you asked to turn on the TV, Google replied that it turned on the plug.

**Now** when you do the same command, Google tries to turn on the Chromecast (which obviously cannot be turned on since it is in the plug) and the plug.

It is quite annoying because sometimes it does not turn on the plug and the same thing happens when turning off the TV. It also responds with the error ""I couldn't turn on the Chromecast.""

I've tried getting the Chromecast out of the room so it won't turn it on, but the speaker has that TV by default to send content.

googlehome,Uranium_Donut_,"[GUIDE] How to use ""wake my lights""","""wake my lights"" works with every single dimmable light source. If it has a slider in the home app, it works.  

Wake my lights brightens the light to the ""last brightness"" over 30 minutes. 

Last brightness is the last brightness value the light had when it was on. If you went to bed with full brightness and then turned the light off, ""wake my lights"" will be at 0% at 0 min, 50% at 15 min and 100% at 30 min. If you turned off your lights at 1% or used ""sleep my lights"" (which does the same) your lights will stay on 0% for 15 minutes, switch to 1% at 15 min and then stay.  

How I use it: me bedtime routine turns on the lights, sets them to 100 and then turns them off.  

Scheduling lights:

Surely you want to wake up by a nice sunrise. If you have to say ""wake my lights"" you are already awake. That's why you want to schedule it. There was a feature called ""gentle sync"" which syncs the light-brightening to your Google home alarm but it is broken since a few months. It now has to be turned on EVERY TIME when you go to bed and starts AT THE TIME of the alarm and stops 30 min after the alarm. (Which is useless for you).

You can say ""wake my lights at 6AM"". This will START waking at 6AM and FINISH at 6:30AM. So if you have to wake up at 6:40AM and want the lights to start 10 min before and finish 20 min after you say ""set an alarm for 6:40AM and wake my lights at 6:30AM"" 

This feature is very finicky and if you change the light between &lt;time of command said&gt; and &lt;when to wake&gt; it will abort the wake.",2021-03-08 18:02:18,1,"[GUIDE] How to use ""wake my lights"" | ""wake my lights"" works with every single dimmable light source.

googlehome,InternationalNebula7,Next Level Smart Thermostat,"Perhaps not directly related to my Google Home setup, but the following will detail how to implement presence detection (via smartphone location and fallback motion detecting sensors) for a dumb WiFi Thermostat (Honeywell Total Connect) to rival the intelligence of a high end smart thermostat. 

&amp;#x200B;

First, I disabled the traditional device Honeywell scheduling settings. Then, I set all future temperature modifications to permanent hold. 

&amp;#x200B;

Using Amazon Alexa Routines (despite not owning an Echo device), I created the following powerful routines:

1) Geo-fenced smartphone location arrival and departure thermostat settings for both Home and Work. (i.e. leave home and set heating to 45 degrees, leave work and set heating to 70 degrees.)

2) Wyze Sense motion trigger and non-motion trigger thermostat settings, with conditional time limitations when I would typically be at work. (i.e. motion between 9a-5p sets heat to 70, no motion for two hours between 9a-5p sets heat to 45.)

3) Time based scheduling thermostat settings (reset at 0100, wake at 0530, pre-sleep at 2030, sleep 2230)

  
Thus I have successfully automated energy savings with presence detection using a smartphone location services and motion detection fallback in a dumb WiFi Thermostat. Although you may own a different or potentially smarter thermostat, similar automation could be implemented in any Alexa supported smart thermostat to make it as smart as the top of the line products out there (i.e. Ecobee, Google Nest).",2021-03-08 03:34:19,1,"Next Level Smart Thermostat | Perhaps not directly related to my Google Home setup, but the following will detail how to implement presence detection (via smartphone location and fallback motion detecting sensors) for a dumb WiFi Thermostat (Honeywell Total Connect) to rival the intelligence of a high end smart thermostat.

googlehome,audio_808,Timing out while pausing,"A small thing but an annoying one. Hoping there's a work around.

Every night me or my partner casts a sleep podcast to the Google home mini in our bedroom, pause it, then we leave our phones on the other side of the room. Read for a bit and/or chat etc. Then when we're ready to sleep one of us says ""okay Google, play"" and 2 out of 3 times this works. But 1 in three times (roughly) it says ""ok, playing [random artist] on YouTube music""

One of the main reasons for having the speaker is not having to look at our phones so much, especially before bed, so it's really annoying to have to get up and play it manually.

Is there a way to stop the cast from timing out? Is there a set amount of time it takes to time out? Any help would be greatfluly received.",2021-03-04 23:57:16,2,"Timing out while pausing | A small thing but an annoying one. Hoping there's a work around.

Now Google assistant says “I can’t do that here, but you can ask me to play it on one of your other devices”. (When I ask, I can‘t play it on my other devices).

I can get Wave 105 via Tune-In on my iPad &amp; phone using the Tune-In app, and Google Home will play other stations from the parent company that owns Wave 105 but I can find no way of playing it on my speakers other than streaming (which I can’t do as an alarm call).

~~EDIT: Yeah, it looks like C by GE is more or less down for everyone. Guess we're stuck twiddling our thumbs until they notice and fix whatever's gone wrong. If you're having issues, I would suggest NOT DOING ANYTHING for now--especially not anything that logs you out of C by GE, removes devices, etc.~~

------------

Anybody else having issues with C by GE integration, and possibly a solution?

After more than a month of everything running smoothly, my Lenovo smart clock was telling me it couldn't reach C by GE when attempting to control my Direct Connect smart bulbs. A quick google suggested the bulbs' firmware might be the issue, so I checked the C by GE app, and sure enough, it showed one available. I tried to apply it, but while it showed as successful and even would say there were no updates to apply, when I'd go back in, the bulbs would once again say they needed a firmware update.

I also tried removing and re-adding the C by GE app connection in Google Home. When I tried logging back in through Google Home, literally nothing at all would happen: the little loading circle would spin after clicking ""Sign In,"" and then it would go back to the pre-submission appearance, with the email and password still entered.

I did a factory reset on the bulbs and removed them from the C by GE app. If I try to add them back using ""Setup in Google Home App,"" I get the same eternal login screen. If I try to add them back in the C by GE app itself via the ""Direct Connect Lights"" option, it takes me to a ""Reset Device"" screen saying, ""Sorry, there is a problem setting up the device. Please reset it to factory settings and try again."" (It then shows a list of devices that I don't have: Switch, Paddle Switch, Toggle Switch, and Plug.) Doing a second factory reset of the bulbs didn't resolve the issue.

I also cleared the app cache, since GE's support has suggested that can resolve issues, but it didn't make any difference.

ETA: Trying to add the bulbs [directly in Google Home by Google's instructions](https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9141859) gives the error ""No Google Assistant devices found,"" even though the bulbs, the phone I'm using Google Home to do the setup on, and the Lenovo smart clock I've been using with Google Assistant for a month to control these same bulbs are all in the same room.

ETA2: Rebooting the clock didn't remind Google it's there; it still won't directly add the bulbs because there's ""no"" Google Assistant device.

**TL;DR: C by GE app integration with Google Home and its associated Direct Connect bulbs are now a hot, completely nonfunctional mess.

googlehome,White_Row92,Google home not intuitive in the slightest?,"Hi all,

I've had my Google home mini for a little while now and really do not get on with it.

A friend of mine is in the Alexa ecosystem and I'm really considering changing.

All I want is to be able to add times to the default routines (because Google stupidly doesn't let you delete them) but you can't. So the 'good morning' routine it appears (to me at least) that you can't actually set a bloody alarm, instead it's voice activated? This seems absolutely inane to me...

Any advice before I yeet it?

When I changed my speed with my ISP a few months back, I could not get the new speed no matter what I did. A Google One support member had me do numerous troubleshooting including the arbitrary reboot and eventually told me to change my router address from xxx.xxx.xxx.1 to xxx.xxx.xxx.10. 

Naturally i thought this guy was nuts but sure enough I was suddenly getting the new speed. I since then had to reset my network to factory and have had it at xxx.1 without issue. Last night I switched speeds again and sure enough I was not getting the advertised speed. Again I changed the router IP to .10 and instantaneously got my full speed. 

I dont know what this bug is. If it's something wrong with my devices, the way they interact with the ISP or if the firmware is bugged. I just wanted to share this illogical solution for documentation purposes for anyone that may have this issue now or in the future.

so I have a very specific issue that I am dealing with at the moment, so I wondered if anyone here could help me out.

I have a nest mini II in my kids room that I use to play his night music. I have also created a routine so whenever he goes to sleep I can just say ""Isak is going to sleep"", and it starts playing my playlist correctly. (I also just say ""hey google, play my playlist ""nightsongs"""".)

My issue though, is that I need my google home to be ably to play that specific playlist when other people ask for it also. Both my wife and mother are unable to get that specific playlist to play. Spotify just searches for a public playlist with the same name.

I know the reason for this is voice match, but without voice match even I won't get it to play my playlist. My spotify account is also the only connected account. My wife does have her own account, but not connected to google home. My mom does not have her own spotify account.

I have thought of maybe solving it with a Flic button, but I don't necessarily want yet another hub of some kind..

I know the reason for this is voice match, but without voice match even I won't get it to play my playlist. My spotify account is also the only connected account. My wife does have her own account, but not connected to google home. My mom does not have her own spotify account.

I have thought of maybe solving it with a Flic button, but I don't necessarily want yet another hub of some kind..

Anyone here have any good ideas of how to solve this?

googlehome,InfiniteRockets,LGCX and Sonos Beam - Confused About Devices In Home,"I recently got an LGCX television and a Sonos Beam which I have set up with my Google Home system. However, I'm a bit confused about what the different elements are and what they represent in the Home app. 

https://preview.redd.it/skvjeb44ssk61.jpg?width=1242&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7824fd79eec05cf31f9eec798e1f20e587adeb85

The Living Room Speaker is obviously representing the Beam, but why are there two devices representing the TV? I can turn the TV on and off with the Sonos TV Control Living Room in the app, and when I use voice commands, it is turning on/off this device (i.e. it says ""Turning off Sonos TV Room Control""). Both the TV and the Beam were independently set up with Google (i.e. the Sonos and LG apps bounced me over to the Assistance/Home apps for setup), but I'd have thought that each one would still only show up as a single device.  

Everything works properly, but the logic behind it is irritating to me because there used to just be a device for the TV and a device for the Beam; I had to get a replacement Beam and so have only encountered this issue during my second time going through this process. I don't think I did anything differently.

Additionally, when I turn off the lights in the same room as the Sonos, I get the spoken ""Turning on/off living room lamp"" rather than the chime that I get in other rooms, even though it's all set up as one room. Any idea on any of this? Happy to provide any other information if it would be helpful.

googlehome,chazelet,Spotify &amp; Google Home &amp; iPhone,"I have an iPhone with the premium version of Spotify. I have all my Google Home speakers set up throughout my home.

Now I already anticipate issues between my phone and Google because Apple can't get along with anyone, but I am getting a little fed up with the user experience, and I can't tell if it's Spotify or Google.

I noticed these issues while listening to music on Spotify. I will start the music in the app on my phone and then start to cast it to my speaker. Most of the time, it connects with no problem, but sometimes it has a problem connecting to a speaker. I'm sitting next to the router so I don't think it'd have anything to do with internet connection.

Sometimes, music will be playing with no problem but then if I go to pause the song on Spotify, the play/pause button is greyed out. The only way to go pause the music is to go into the Google Home app and pause it that way. Why is this?

I also try to pause the music by pulling down the control center on my phone, but it says there is no music playing.

Another issue I have while listening to music is I basically can't do anything else on my phone that uses volume (like watch a video on Instagram or snapchat), because if I press the volume keys, the music turns up on the speaker. Is there a way around this? I feel like since it is casting to the speaker, it should be known that I'm not trying to turn up the speaker volume, and instead am trying to watch the video on my phone.

googlehome,Kaldea,"Google Home Hub / Nest Hub - All audio stops without reason, resetting fixes temporarily?","Hi everyone!

I've got an original Google Home Hub (before the re-name) that's never really encountered any issues before, however in the past week or so it's been randomly going silent.

For instance, I have it in the kitchen and normally will ask Google to play the news while I'm doing the dishes. I can see on the screen that it recognizes my request and will begin playing the news on the screen, but it's completely silent.

If I try to turn the volume up, I don't hear the ""bloops"" you hear when you're adjusting the volume level.

I will unplug it from power, have it reboot, and the sound will come back. It'll then work usually for the rest of the day, but by the next morning, the problem returns. The only time it's worked the next morning was a time I used several hours earlier than normal in the day, so I'm not sure if there's some correlation with amount of time it's inactive?

Has anyone else experienced this before? I wanted to check here before I go through Google's support, since this is sort of a difficult thing to troubleshoot since nothing has changed in my routine in months.

During set up the Home app is able to see the thermostats and adds them to my wifi network, however on the final step I get an error message that something has gone wrong.  I've been in contact with Google nest support and they tried to help but no luck as of yet.  So far did factory reset, restart on thermostats. Removed and reinstalled Home app on my pixel.

googlehome,tomdaspartan,Is there a way to stream music to a Google Home device and Alexa device at the same time?,"To set the stage...
I have a Google Home Max and love it. I also have an old cd/cassette stereo that is analog that I love. What I would like to do is use the Max and stereo together as a speaker group. However, I don't believe the Max has an output and if it did, would it play audio through both speakers? Not certain. 

I have an old Alexa that does have an audio output. Tried to pair the two and it seems successful but can't get audio to output from all speakers. There is a way to create a speaker group but Home doesn't show the Alexa as an available speaker to add. And same result trying to create a speaker group through Alexa, adding the Max. 

I may just have to buy a separate Bluetooth receiver or adapter and see if that will work instead of the Alexa but wanted to see if this could work before spending more money. 

Any help? Thanks in advance.",2021-02-27 02:26:17,1,"Is there a way to stream music to a Google Home device and Alexa device at the same time? | To set the stage...

googlehome,WidowmakerSix,Google Nest Audio Speaker Pair Delay with Video (PLEASE FIX),"Until Google provides an update or some kind of delay correction setting for two Nest Audio speakers set up as a speaker pair (Left/Right):

I ended up getting a [Mpow Bluetooth 5.0 Transmitter Receiver](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B081B3DGKH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) to connect to my line out and USB of my laptop.  The USB is just for charging the Mpow.  I then just followed these steps:

1. Switch the Mpow to transmit (TX) and pair the first speaker under the Google Home app &gt; Speaker One &gt; Device Settings &gt; Paired Bluetooth devices &gt; Enable Pairing Mode.
2. Push the pairing button on the Mpow and pair the second speaker while enabling pairing mode under the Google Home app &gt; Speaker Two &gt; Device Settings &gt; Paired Bluetooth devices &gt; Enable Pairing Mode.

Issues with this:

* The speakers drift apart from each other after a long time and you have to switch the Mpow off and then back to transmit to correct the issue.  The echo does sound cool sometimes though.
* Basically, you get a center channel out of two speakers instead of a L/R speaker pair.  Not cool.
* The video to audio delay is very slight - like if you only paired one of these speakers to the computer

The Mpow device did come with an informative card with these tables:

**Codec of one connected device:**

|Your Headphone support|The final transmission Codec will be|The audio delay will be|
|:-|:-|:-|
|aptX HD|aptX HD|/|
|aptX Low Latency|aptX Low Latency|&lt;-40ms|
|aptX|aptX|&lt;-130ms|
|SBC|SBC|&lt;-220ms|

**Codec of two connected devices:**

|Your First headphone support|Your Second Headphone support|The final transmission Codec will be|The audio delay will be|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|aptX HD|aptX HD|aptX HD|/|

|aptX Low Latency / aptX|aptX HD|SBC|&lt;-220ms|
|aptX Low Latency|aptX|SBC|&lt;-220ms|

Why couldn't Google just add an output jack if speaker pairing only works as intended when you listen to music?  Pretty poor that there is a built-in audio delay when these speakers are paired.  I hope the software can be fixed.  Maybe Google just has it switching Codecs when the pair is made? Standing by now on the preview program or an answer from Google.  Leaving  a review at [https://store.google.com/product/nest\_audio](https://store.google.com/product/nest_audio) \- oh wait, I can't.

Maybe Mpow could make a similar device where it only transmits one channel to each speaker.

googlehome,addmanrcace,Nest Cam stream stopping after giving any command?,"Hey all, sorry if this has already been asked but I couldn't find anything related. 

We use our hubs and hub max quite frequently with Nest Cams to work as a baby monitor. At some point in the past few weeks something has changed and the streams are closing after we issue a command (most commands).

It used to always return to the camera stream after a command, but now it seems to pull up a screen for our command and then return to the home screen.

For example:

1. We are streaming camera.
2. We tell google to turn off the kitchen lights.
3. It turns off the lights and shows the Kitchen Lights control screen.
4. It returns to the home screen.

googlehome,pheregas,Cold Weather Low Power on Nest,"I got one of the new Google Nest Thermostats for Christmas.  Sleek.  Modern.  Easy to install and looks great.  I wired it fine and tested it, even in January, and it fired up the A/C just fine.  No problems connecting it to the WiFi.

I should note that I have steam/radiant heat from a boiler from a separate thermostat on the first floor.  My A/C blower is on the third floor in the attic space, with the condenser on the roof.

A week ago, my Nest started reporting that it had low power.  I immediately checked the breakers, all connections and basically everything I could think of and nothing, M20 error.

Looking up error codes didn't help much, so I decided to just leave it alone.  My HVAC guy was coming for boiler maintenance in March and I'd ask him then.  It wasn't getting warm in my part of the country any time soon, so no rush.

But then a funny thing happened.  The temperature went up from the teens/low 20s and back up into the 30s.  And suddenly the Nest had sufficient power again!

Nothing changed except the outside temperature (and presumably the temperature where the blower unit is housed.).  

Is it possible that the low temperature messed with the voltage being fed to the Nest?",2021-02-24 19:58:02,3,"Cold Weather Low Power on Nest | I got one of the new Google Nest Thermostats for Christmas.

googlehome,thegoomonster,"Lenovo 7"" vs Google Nest Hub","A few months ago I asked this subreddit whether I should get the Lenovo Smart Display 7"" or another Nest Hub. I had been wanting to get a smart display in my kitchen since mid last year. Something to let me watch videos or listen to music while cooking. Video calling would be a bonus as my grandmother loves to video call me while I cook. 

After taking in the communities suggestions, and waiting for specials; I got the Lenovo Smart Display 7"". Here's why.

People mentioned the display wasn't as good as the Hub, and while I do agree, it's not as bad as others make it out to be. While both are 600p, 720p YouTube videos look more then adequate on the Lenovo compared to the Hub's smoother and more vibrate display. The only major difference the displays have that I feel should be noted is frame rate. The Lenovo only displays up to 30fps, while the Hub does solid 60fps. Not a deal breaker for me but for some it might be. Duo Calls look decent. Photos look just as good as on the hub from a distance. The cool tone shift can be finicky and I haven't found a way to turn it off but honestly I don't feel like it's a turn off. I feel that could be fixed with software.

Moving onto speakers; on the Lenovo they are waaaaaay better. Like the Hub was fine, slightly better then a Mini in my opinion. The Lenovo has 2 x 1.5"" 5W speakers which are facing forward and have seperation, with a passive radiator to boost bass. At 75% volume, it was filling my whole kitchen, with good bass and no decernable sound distortion. While the Hub has a ""full range speaker"" that's backwards facing and no audio seperation; I could not find any stats on the Hub's speaker which is somewhat concerning. I put them side to side and the Lenovo sounded fuller, bassier and just more lively.  While the Hub sounded quieter, not much bass and I had to get it to around 90% to get close to the Lenovo, but with some distortion.

The webcam is honestly kinda crap. But this wasn't  meant to be a video conferencing machine. I did a video call to myself and honestly the video quality was serviceable, and because the display was at a better angle then the Hub, I was actually able to position it so that it showed me standing at the stove without having to prop it up on something.

Regarding the assistant functionality. It's basically the same. The Lenovo updated when set up and has that new UI that the Hub has. Hot word functionality worked the same as the Hub when placed in the same spot. The ultrasonic motion detection on the Hub isn't here on the Lenovo, so UI elements don't hide/show when you walk near it but I felt that was gimicky anyway.

I bought the Lenovo Smart display for AU$99, which I felt was a good price. Usually both the Hub and Lenovo Smart Display 7"" are AU$129 but I feel thats a little too much for me personally. 

Overall, thumbs up for the Lenovo Smart Display 7"" from me. Far from perfect but I feel like ever Assistant based speaker or display has their weaknesses. I do wish the Lenovo came in full black, so smudges and dirt don't show on the edges but that's nitpicking at this rate. I'd recommend the Lenovo for the kitchen or other utility areas. While the Hub for living areas.

Maximus - “set lights to 100%”
Luminous - “set lights to 80%”
Minimus - “set lights to 30%”
Night Light - “set lights to 1%”
Nox/Knox - “turn off lights”

Hydrate - “turn on humidifier”
Desiccate - “turn off humidifier”",idea for routine shortcut | i ve made a few one command routine for two reason they re just easier to say and the google home doesn t well usually doesn t respond ok turning device on i try to choose keywords that ll be seldom used otherwise thing like fake latin or harry potter spell if it fit wondering if anyone ha done the same to give idea maybe there s something i ve been missing my list maximus set light to 100 luminous set light to 80 minimus set light to 30 night light set light to 1 nox knox turn off light hydrate turn on humidifier desiccate turn off humidifier,113
googlehome,yjamal01,Using 2 x Google Home Max as TV Speaker - what kinda of cheap bluetooth chip is in here?,"So I managed to grab 2 google home maxs for $500, probably still overpriced but I wanted one and then somehow I bought 2.  


Sound is awesome...the original plan was to connect it via bluetooth to my TV. Unfortunately this did not work as there is sooo much stuttering its horrible,   


I then tried to use a bluetooth receiver and use the aux input (my TV does not have an aux output). This removed the sturrering issue, but now there was an audio delay.   


So for testing purposes I tried one google home via bluetooth. Minimal stuttering but still present. Tried the bluetooth receiver and aux. Works, but is not ideal since I want to use the pair. I can't believe a device that retailed for $350 has such a horrible bluetooth chip.  


So, knowing absolutely nothing, I am wondering if this can work, and if its just pointless  


1. Spdif in/aux out converter --&gt; connects to TV
2. Aux out to stereo breaker --&gt; separate the 2 channels 
3. Connect 1 to left, connect 1 to right --&gt;Utilize both speakers via aux

Should work in theory right?

googlehome,Owenboy89,Best Smart wall sockets and light switches,"Hey everyone

I already have Google home and use it to control TV with harmony hub and the RGB in that area but now I am looking to make my home even smarter. 

I seen these adapters that plug into the wall and then your device into that device....I have obviously seen the bulbs as well but that type of system isn't going to work for my household as we like to switch off most our sockets when we leave. (The only ones that stay on is the plug to the Internet, which has a Google home mini, and house phone on same extension lead and our fridge-freezer. 

So my in our situation I think fitting smart sockets and light switches are the way to go......only issue is there are thousands to choose from Ebay and Amazon....and was hoping you peeps could suggest some of the best that are a good bang for the buck. 

Here is a list of things I need

1. Reasonably easy wiring, I rent so the sockets would be come with me if or when I moved....I am multiskilled engineer from trade so I can do basic electrics pretty safely.

2. No requirement of a hub....I would prefer not to have extra stuff that needs to be fitted as I am thinking of getting the Eufy camera security system which will require a hub and I don't want to end up with a cupboard full of hubs.

3. Been wired into the house electrics safety is key, I know I could go on ebay and buy the cheapest kit on there.....but sometimes that's not the safest thing to do on especially with electrics. 

4. The might be the most obvious one as I am on Google Home sub reddit but it needs to be compatible with a Google Home.....I would like to be able to set some routines like ""OK Google.....I going to work now"" and it turns off all smart plugs and lights off.....or ""Goodnight Google"" and it turns all plugs and lights off except the bedroom plugs

5. I don't want to have to pay top dollar, I am looking good value for money...so all of the above for a good price. 

6. (Just added this one quick via edit).....I am in the UK so i need UK versions of sockets and lightswitches. UK can be a pain for some companies  because of the amount of laws we have around electrical safety and our three pronged wall sockets....so some companies just skip us brits completely. 

Hope these help with your suggestions.

It wasnt music or tv or anything, it was just static? I dont know, thats the best way i can describe it (i was pretty groggy so my memory isnt helping). But it was at max volume, even my dogs were freaking out. 

I said Okay google stop, and it stopped and i went to bed. This morning I checked the history on it, and it registers my command to turn off the lights at 1AM when I went to sleep, and It registers the command of me saying stop at 4:06AM, but it does not show anything else that could have triggered it. 

My dad says the only thing would be I was hacked or someone tried to stream something to my Google. I dont believe that because it wasnt playing music or anything really, just static. And it would have to be someone on my network.

googlehome,eatshibby,"""OK Google, Stop"" fails on every speaker. Attempts to pause a group that doesn't exist?","We use Google Minis in every bedroom for sleep sounds and after a power outage, they are no longer able to stop themselves when playing audio.

Regardless of the room, Master Bedroom, or Kids Room A or Kids Room B, whenever a speaker is playing sleep sounds and I say ""OK Google, Stop"" the command fails and the speaker always responds with the same phrase ""Sorry, I can't find Kids Room A plus two, please make sure that device is turned on and connected to the internet.""

Now, if I address the specific speaker directly, for example if the Master Bedroom is playing sleep sounds and I say ""OK Google, Stop playing on the Master Bedroom Mini"" then the sleep sounds stop. Same thing for the other rooms. Addressing the speakers directly works fine. But just saying ""OK Google, Stop"" doesn't work at all.

It sounds to me that the response ""I can't find Kids Room A plus two"" is a speaker group? But I don't have any speaker groups set up in my home. I've already removed the devices from my home, factory reset them using the button on the bottom of the Minis and re-added them to my home. Nothing has worked thus far.

This is seriously pissing off my wife so I'd like to get this resolved ASAP. Any insight or help is greatly appreciated.",2021-02-22 15:33:55,1,"""OK Google, Stop"" fails on every speaker.

googlehome,NoSock93,Playing Netflix from Google Home behind VPN?,"I have ExpressVPN set up on the router, and all the traffic is tunneled through it. When I turn the VPN on, I can watch geoblocked content on Netflix on most devices, and even cast it the Chromecast with no issues. However, if I ask my Google Home Mini to play something geoblocked, I get ""I looked for %ShowName% on Netflix, but it either isn't available or can't be played right now"".

Is the GH Netflix integration using some extra special-sause geolocation detection? I tried to reroute Google DNS and OpenDNS with static routes, but that doesn't seem to help.

Maybe someone is running a similar setup? I found [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/6m8afk/does_anyone_have_their_gh_on_a_vpn/) discussing something similar, but the guy there uses Getflix, which is a smart DNS as opposed to a VPN.

googlehome,ssipik,TVs compatible with voice commands,"Hi,

My current setup consists of Google Home Speaker + Chromecast + (dumb) TV. During the years I became quite addicted to ""Hey Google play XXX on Netflix"".

Now I would like to upgrade my TV and the starting search criteria is sadly compatibility with Google Home voice commands. I would also like to achieve this without a Chromecaset device or any other streaming device.  And I would like to use the Google Home Speaker for voice commands and not the TV remote. Basically I would still like to tell ""Hey Google play XXX on Netflix"" to the Google Home Speaker and it plays directly on the TV.

From the documentation I could find, this should be possible with TVs running Android TV and with build-in Chromecast.  I would like to ask for your tips or feedback regarding the options that I have.

1. Sony TVs - from the documentation and the demos I have seen they should work straightforward. Any of you share this experience?
2. Philips TVs - demos show they should work, but nowhere in the specs is mentioned the Chromecast function (at least with the current line-up). Could anyone confirm if this function is indeed present?
3. TVs with other OSes (e.g., Samsung, LG) - from what I read in the forum, the integration with Google assistant commands is very limited. But if anyone has some positive experience with this setup please share.

This happens every single time I cast, and only happens once. Spotify is still connected to  the GHome when this occurs, as the name of the devices still show at the bottom of the Spotify app as being casted to. 

I've tried the following to resolve:
* Reboot GHome Devices
* Factory Reset all devices
* Change all GHome Devices from 5GHz wifi to 2.4GHz
* Unlink and relink Spotify account from GHome

Nothing has resolved the issue. I'd like to note, Amazon Echo devices do not seem to have this problem. All GHome Devices are close to my WiFi AP and the network is stable for all other devices.

googlehome,Hot-Seaworthiness633,Dog Bark Detection Should be a Feature of the Speakers,"Why is glass shattering more useful or easier to detect then dog barking? I honestly can't figure that out. I don't want a video stream of my apt at all times, I literally just want bark detection. Why would I need to get a Wyse cam or any cam to detect barking? I JUST want that, no video. The dogs are in crates, I don't leave them with rawhides or destructible toys to choke on. I WILL PAY FOR THIS! Let me pay 6-15$ a month for bark detection, I will! I don't want live video of everything I do to be available for somebody to hack. I'm not that interesting anyway, but its the creep factor that I hate. I'm willing to deal with the constant listening, not the constant recording, that is where I put my foot down. 

The uninteresting background of why I want this feature: I have 2 dogs and we lived in a house in the Midwest and my commute was about 1 hour each way, so I was gone 11 hours a day (8 hrs + 1 hr lunch + 2  one hour commutes). We moved to an apartment in Megacity (for a promotion) so I could be close to work and could come home on lunches to play with the dogs. They took time to adjust because apts are loud, full of strangers, and they are young so they didn't know what was going on. I have this really dumb setup where I use my ancient iPad using a most likely very insecure app, that for all I know is created to spy on me but it was the only thing I could find, to watch my dogs using my phone because it has bark detection. The app works, but its very inconvenient because it disconnects, it requires video and I don't need to see the dogs, and I have to have the iPad plugged in so I have an iPad laying on the floor near the dogs all day charging. Its hard to train a dog to not bark when you are not home. They very rarely bark when I'm home but they do occasionally when I'm not and I work close enough to go home and stop them, but I can only do that if I know they are barking. One is a husky, so no a bark collar will not work. The other is an Aussie and I do have a $125 Garmin bark collar for him, but it works too well because he's terrified of it even on the lowest setting. I'm not willing to use that unless I'm there to explain to him what is happening so he doesn't think he's being tortured.

googlehome,CapinWinky,Duo calling/ringing getting on my last nerve.,"I just want to get a pulse on the current state of Duo calling settings just to be sure they haven't updated this. It seems like the entire Nest paradigm is designed for people that live alone and have one nest device; I live with my wife and kids and we both have pixel phones and we have several nest speakers/displays about the house.

- If either of us gets a duo call, it rings all the devices in the house. It does not matter if we are home or not or the state of our phone, our phone rings and every device rings and the call is answered by whatever picks up first. 
    - Can we still not tell it to only ring the house when we're home?
    - Can we still not tell certain devices to only ring for certain people?
    - Can we still not just block the devices from ringing at all without removing their ability to make duo calls?
    - Can we turn off incoming duo calls but keep on device to device duo calls and outgoing calls? Nope, all or nothing!
- There is no way to call a device without using a voice command or using the Home app to call the entire house.
    - Grampa wants to call the house like its a landline to talk to the kids? Nope, he's got to call one of us and the whole fucking house will ring because only people with a google device in our ""home"" can call an individual device.
    - I want to call ""My Kitchen Display""? 50:50 chance it's going to call Mike's Kitchen Displays in New Jersey. ""The Playroom Display""? 90% chance it's going to call a toy store in Australia. Can I use the Home app to reliably call a single device or device group? No, voice only.

I mean, sure, roll out Duo calling fast so people with the Nest Hub Max aren't sitting there wondering what the fuck they have a display with a camera for if it doesn't support video calls during a pandemic. But it's now been a long ass time and they have not put any effort into this bullshit. They need to hire a dev with a spouse and young kids and figure this shit out.

Also, if I whisper to my display to turn off a light at 11PM and it fucking replies verbally at volume 11 one more fucking time I'm going to lose it.

It seems like the entire Nest paradigm is designed for people that live alone and have one nest device; I live with my wife and kids and we both have pixel phones and we have several nest speakers/displays about the house.

- If either of us gets a duo call, it rings all the devices in the house. It does not matter if we are home or not or the state of our phone, our phone rings and every device rings and the call is answered by whatever picks up first. 
    - Can we still not tell it to only ring the house when we're home?
    - Can we still not tell certain devices to only ring for certain people?
    - Can we still not just block the devices from ringing at all without removing their ability to make duo calls?
    - Can we turn off incoming duo calls but keep on device to device duo calls and outgoing calls? Nope, all or nothing!
- There is no way to call a device without using a voice command or using the Home app to call the entire house.
    - Grampa wants to call the house like its a landline to talk to the kids? Nope, he's got to call one of us and the whole fucking house will ring because only people with a google device in our ""home"" can call an individual device.
    - I want to call ""My Kitchen Display""? 50:50 chance it's going to call Mike's Kitchen Displays in New Jersey. ""The Playroom Display""? 90% chance it's going to call a toy store in Australia. Can I use the Home app to reliably call a single device or device group? No, voice only.

I mean, sure, roll out Duo calling fast so people with the Nest Hub Max aren't sitting there wondering what the fuck they have a display with a camera for if it doesn't support video calls during a pandemic. But it's now been a long ass time and they have not put any effort into this bullshit. They need to hire a dev with a spouse and young kids and figure this shit out.

Also, if I whisper to my display to turn off a light at 11PM and it fucking replies verbally at volume 11 one more fucking time I'm going to lose it.

googlehome,TalonTrax,Need Confirmation: Voice control doesn't really work on Google TV using Google Home speakers (not using the included remote),"I have 1 Chromecast and 1 Google Home speaker in 3 different rooms of the house.

For the past couple years, when I'm using my phone to cast Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime to the room I'm in, I can say ""Hey Google pause"" so I can leave the room quickly without fumbling for my phone. Then say ""Hey Google play"" when I walk back in.

Also, while watching, I've always been able to say ""Hey Google..."":

- fast forward XX seconds
- rewind XX seconds
- start at the beginning
- next episode
- etc...

I replaced a Chromecast in one room with a Google TV and kept the Google Home speaker. Now, when I give the above voice commands, the Assistant says ""Nothing's playing right now."" I get this message regardless of whether I cast it from my phone or initiate the video with the remote.

Now, I tinkered with GTV settings and actually bluetooth connected it to my GH speaker. THEN I could do all the voice commands, but the audio only would play through the speaker, not the TV. I did not see a place in settings in (Google Home app or Google TV) to select where the output of the Google TV audio could be routed.

As soon as I 'disconnected' the bluetooth connection, the audio played on the TV again, but I lost voice control as well.

googlehome,dnchakawri,GH Home/Away routine not executing any given action,"Hi, I'm having trouble with the Google Home home/away routine. 

I have a few HUE light bulbs and some other devices which I want to turn on/off depending on when I'm not home or coming home. It still gets my location and prompts me that it is switching to 'home' or 'away' profile on my phone and I can confirm it by opening the GH app and I see it doing the correct thing. But none of the actions I added are being executed. I can still switch manually from home to away or the other way around but nothing happens... no lights are triggered. All lights work fine when manually turning them on or asking the assistent to turn them on. But it looks like the home/away routine is ghosted or something.

I deleted everything: All routines, my HUE account, my 'home', also tried to turn off battery optimisation etc. Synced my devices, tried it on another phone, delete conflicting apps (IFTTT).

Even installed a older version of GH but nothing worked.

&amp;#x200B;

The only clue I have is when I ask GH to manually activate the routine by saying : 'everyone is away' I don't get a answer. And when I say: 'everyone is home' it will play me a song from spotify??? 

Makes me think the entire routine doesn't exist, only in the GH app...

Now, because I'm so stubborn I've been okay with this for months, but it's starting to get on my nerves.

So I've got a Google Home Mini and I also use Google Audio Chromecast so I can ask Google to play Spotify on some speakers that I have. I also have Spotify on my iPhone. 

Whenver I ask Google to play Spotify on these Speakers, I can only control some of Spotify on my phone. I can't play anything off some of my playlists, but I can control volume and other of my playists, public playlists, albums, etc. But my MAIN playlist that I use, me hitting any of the buttons on the app does nothinggggggg. As soon as I disconnect from Google, everything works fine again. Why are only some of my playlists accessible, meanwhile others aren't? This is so odd.

I can also play this playlist specifically by saying ""Hey Google, play playlist \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ on \_\_\_\_\_\_ speakers"", and it does, but I still can't select any specific tracks on my Spotify app from the playlist, nor can I shuffle it. It'll start playing from oldest to newest song and I can shuffle from the individual song view itself, but yeah the playlist view just doesn't respond at all.

googlehome,Affectionate_Mess425,Google Home/Assistant custom voice command without invoking app,"Hi there!  


I recently learned there is a way to build an App within google's dialogflow to make custom commands, and custom responds.

In my understanding, this thing was basically created for developers whom make such apps that can use a ""custom google-hooked interaction-system"".

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know, if I could use this basically for a somewhat IFTTT-like custom-command interface.

I would want to use it to send commands into my nodered, which is already setup  with Join (Joao) pushes and recievers, to make my lights turn on or off, turn on pc etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem at first is, as far as I can tell, I would need to say ""hey google talk to xy app"", and only after that, I could say ""turn on my lights"".

&amp;#x200B;

Is it possible to make this dialogflow app, so I would only need to say ""hey google, turn on lights"", and it would just simply send a webhook request (or if I'm saying it wrong, send a simple link which is a request in Joao's server, that sends out the request to my specific device)? Like it does in IFTTT?

&amp;#x200B;

I read that dialogflow can use ""implicit invocations"", but that only means it will decide on it's own if it can run my applet I built with  dialogflow, and even if it does decide to use mine by it's algorithm, it would also ask back ""For that, you might like xy app.  Wanna give it a try?

googlehome,rhesusfecespieces,2nd Gen Nest Minis (others?) that frequently disconnect and have to be setup again,"Some are experiencing a problem where the 2nd Gen Nest speaker (usually a mini) will unlink from your home and have to be setup again. Some see it happen daily. Others (myself) see it happen every few days.  It basically renders the device unusable. 

I decided to commit some time today to pursuing the problem with a support person at Google. 

It didn't end well. 

Basically the conclusion is that some devices do this if the network is unstable or the power is interrupted, they don't know why, and they're trying to figure it out. They won't replace your device because YOU are supposed to provide stable power and network (imagine if your phone reset to factory defaults every time you lost a signal or ran out of battery).

The only conclusion I can draw is that these gen 2 speakers are are either poorly designed, built, or tested, and Google has no intention of taking care of anyone foolish enough to buy one that doesn't work. I suspect that third party compatible speakers might be OK, but buying a Google speaker is definitely a gamble. 

Here is a transcript of my chat this afternoon:

\---

Thanks for contacting us! My name is Ned. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about Google Home speaker or Google Nest speaker.

Hi rhesusfecespieces!

Give me time to read your transcript for me to understand your query.

Thanks for giving me time to read your transcript. As what I've read your Google Nest Mini keeps on disconnecting.

No worries! I'm here to help and let's work together to resolve this issue.

What troubleshooting steps have we done so far prior contacting us?

Ned · 1:19 PM

I have performed factory reset quite a few times. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Google Home app as well, to ensure latest version. Lastly, I placed the device close to the wifi base.

1:20 PM

Gotcha! Thanks for trying rhesusfecespieces; Can we check on feed history to check if there's unlink history of your device?

Ned · 1:20 PM

Yes

1:21 PM

Alrighty! Here's how we check the feed history: Let's open Google Home app then on the main page we'll tap on the 3rd icon located on the bottom that looks like a overlapping square.

Ned · 1:21 PM

yes

1:22 PM

Please check if you can find unlink history on the feed history.

Ned · 1:22 PM

I have a box that says: ""Dog House speaker unlinked &lt;redacted&gt;@gmail.com  unlinked Dog House speaker from your home"" on February 7.

1:26 PM

Thanks! Can you take a screenshot on your feed history that show unlink?

Ned · 1:27 PM

&lt;screenshot&gt;

Thanks! Let me check.

Got it! Let me send this to our seniors.

By the way, the device unlink every day right?

Ned · 1:31 PM

Not every day. Usually within a week.

1:31 PM

Got it! No any network outage on your area or power interruption right?

Ned · 1:32 PM

That last event followed a power failure, actually.

1:32 PM

**Got it! If there's any power interruption within your area sometimes the device will lost the connection on the it's internet connection.**

That's one of the reason why the device disconnect.

either power interruption or network outage.

Ned · 1:35 PM

Wait..

1:35 PM

Alrighty

Ned · 1:35 PM

if the network is interrupted then the Nest Mini will have to be reinstalled?

My gen 1 minis don't do that...

1:36 PM

It may or may not; sometimes the device will lost the connection if the outage will take sometime.

Ned · 1:37 PM

How long an outage can it withstand?

1:37 PM

Yeah I understand that the other device wont disconnect; not all Google Nest Mini disconnect if there's casual outage on the internet nor power interruption.

The reason why the device disconnect because we need the device to have stable network connection or power so that the device wont disconnect from it's network.

Ned · 1:39 PM

Err.. are you saying that every gen 2 Nest Mini will disconnect and have to be reinstalled in the event of a short power failure or network interruption?

1:39 PM

No not all Google Nest Mini, even other Google Home Mini will disconnect if there isn't stable connection or power connection.

Ned · 1:41 PM

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether the device is designed to reset if the network or power drops, and if so, how long of an outage is necessary. The second question is whether this is a problem that can be resolved by replacing the device.

1:43 PM

rhesusfecespieces we can't verify that here because our product engineer design the device to have stable network connection and power so that the device wont disconnect from its network. I understand that you're trying to figure out this issue.

Ned · 1:46 PM

Let me check some information here in my end and you can also send notification to our develop regarding this issue through: [https://developers.google.com/products/.](https://developers.google.com/products/)

Ned · 1:47 PM

No other speakers in my home will do this..

1:47 PM

Yeah I understand because not all Google Home Mini nor Google nest Mini and other device doin same issue as you have.

You can verify that since not all of your device disconnected even though you have power/network outage.

Ned · 1:48 PM

I don't understand.. what is Google actually doing to address the problem?

1:49 PM

Actually they're investigating this concern why there are some device that will disconnect on if there are power/network outage but we don't have specific time frame when can they fix this problem.

We can send feedback to our product engineer by: Open the Google Home app then choose the device at the homepage.

Go to Settings and at the top right corner, tap the 3 dots. Choose Help &amp; feedback.

At the bottom part, choose SUBMIT FEEDBACK REPORT then tap the device you'd like to submit feedback for.

Type your feedback.

Err.. are you saying that every gen 2 Nest Mini will disconnect and have to be reinstalled in the event of a short power failure or network interruption?

1:39 PM

No not all Google Nest Mini, even other Google Home Mini will disconnect if there isn't stable connection or power connection.

Ned · 1:41 PM

I guess what I'm trying to figure out is whether the device is designed to reset if the network or power drops, and if so, how long of an outage is necessary. The second question is whether this is a problem that can be resolved by replacing the device.

1:43 PM

rhesusfecespieces we can't verify that here because our product engineer design the device to have stable network connection and power so that the device wont disconnect from its network. I understand that you're trying to figure out this issue.

Ned · 1:46 PM

Let me check some information here in my end and you can also send notification to our develop regarding this issue through: [https://developers.google.com/products/.](https://developers.google.com/products/)

Ned · 1:47 PM

No other speakers in my home will do this..

1:47 PM

Yeah I understand because not all Google Home Mini nor Google nest Mini and other device doin same issue as you have.

You can verify that since not all of your device disconnected even though you have power/network outage.

Ned · 1:48 PM

I don't understand.. what is Google actually doing to address the problem?

1:49 PM

Actually they're investigating this concern why there are some device that will disconnect on if there are power/network outage but we don't have specific time frame when can they fix this problem.

We can send feedback to our product engineer by: Open the Google Home app then choose the device at the homepage.

Go to Settings and at the top right corner, tap the 3 dots. Choose Help &amp; feedback.

At the bottom part, choose SUBMIT FEEDBACK REPORT then tap the device you'd like to submit feedback for.

Type your feedback.

googlehome,HowYaGuysDoin,Google Home doesn't know it's own name?,"I have a speaker that was recently ignoring all ""Stop"" requests when it was playing white noise. After a factory reset and some tinkering, it looks like that 'stop' command must have been erroneously going to another speaker, for some reason.

googlehome,Texguy82,Onkyo Receivers Offline/Not Working with Google Home App,"Having problems with 2 Onkyo receivers that just don’t work within my Google Home setup.

When I first got the receivers they worked consistently with Google Home App, within speaker groups they were assigned, and with voice commands. 

After a few months of using them, and a few updates by GH, everything went downhill.

Both devices pretty much remain “offline” within the Google Home App, and cannot be used via voice commands at any GH speaker. They still show up listed under their room location but with no “Play music” beneath speaker name, and when clicked into say device offline. The Onkyo controller app sees them, and Spotify app sees them just fine and I can select them as source to play music on from there, but can’t play them in speaker groups for whole home audio or link them with other rooms. 

To get them to work again I have to jump through hoops of power cycling the devices, restarting router, deleting them from Home, and reinstalling again. This usually will get them to be “online” again in Google Home App, and responsive to voice commands, but this only lasts for 1 day before going back offline permanently. 

Tried both Onkyos on 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands, and currently have them directly connected to router via ethernet. Both receivers have latest firmware updates and all devices have static IPs. 

This is just extremely frustrating because for the first few months they worked flawlessly, but for over a year now have dealt with this bs of not working. Have tried Google Support with no luck, so any advice would be appreciated.

The Nest Hub Max only comes with a 1.5m power cable, so I am looking to make it longer/get an extension (as I need to run the cable behind some furniture with very limited space).

Does anybody know the type of DC plugs being used?

Someone reported online that the male plug was 4.5mm/2.8mm, which seems to be a very unusual size.

Someone else reported a power supply from a HP Chromebook (with ""blue tip"") was compatible?

In that case, it would be a 4.5 / 3.0 mm male plug. Finding the female part seems to be very hard.

lately I've been digging into mesh. Their ups and downs and wired APs too.

First I would like to clarify I live in the Caribbean so our houses are mostly concrete with steel bars almost always.

I'm looking to optimize the wifi not only where I will move (a 200 sq mt apartment or 2,150 sq ft) but I'm also looking for my parents house ( 330sqmt or 3,550 sqft)

Both places have walls made of concrete.
So what I'm looking for is advice. I have my eyes set on deco M5 mesh system but there are like half the reviews talking about latency while others say the system works. 

Our internet speed is 60mbps for both.

Both houses are not for heavy gaming, mostly streaming in HD, surfing, downloading movies etc. 

P.D: I'm looking for solutions that let me get wifi all over both houses, but said thing cant cost more than 200 us at once (heavy tax restrictions on buys over 200 us in my country)

Very frustrating! We have a Youtube Premium Family account so that the kids (and us) can play whatever they like. (Ideally not repeatedly but it does happen :).)

After much troubleshooting, I found the solution!

Go into the device settings of each speaker.

Then go to Digital wellbeing, then filters, then videos and click on ""Allow any video"". And suddenly everything works fine.

googlehome,ComicalSkate,Help making a perfect morning routine/wake up alarm,"Hi there. I am a man who struggles to get out of bed in the morning without natural sunlight streaming in, so ever since I've moved back to my parents due to COVID, where my room is in the basement with a small West facing window, my sleep schedule has been messed up. I tried buying a Google Home and Yeelight to make sure that when I set an alarm before bed, I will get up no problem the next morning.

Problem is that Google Home really appears to lock in what you can do with alarms. You see, I want a way to say Goodnight, for it to ask what time I want to get up, to shut off my light, then play sleep sounds. That part is easy, I have that down. However it would seem the only way to get my morning routine to play with it turning on my light alongside an alarm is for it to play the exact same alarm sound which my brain learns to hate and will sleepily keep saying snooze until it is way later than I intended to get up.

So I ask. Is there any way to have a night routine which connects to a morning routine but the alarm that bridges them is a media alarm that will instantly begin playing a set of music I want and turn on my light? Because that would be the best way for me to wake up in the morning but it seems to be impossible to do with Google Home's limited customization for things like that.  


If anyone has any tips then I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!",2021-02-09 17:03:00,1,"Help making a perfect morning routine/wake up alarm | Hi there.

The routines seem to be working as expected, but at random times after the turn off routine, the lights will turn on, I can check them at midnight and they will be off, but at 7am they will be on again.

Has anyone had this issue happening? and also, I've tried to figure out if this is the assistant, is there a way to see what the assistant has done with the lights?

googlehome,sebastienbo,Google nest groups unstable wifi solution (disable airtime fairness as workarround ),"Guys,

I finally figured out why some routers  have problems with your nest groups going up and down. For asus there is a feature call 'airtime fairness' that blocks chatty devices or protocols and they kill the sync packets

See my bug report below as well as the solution steps:

Bug report : compatibility issues with Google home groups (nest groups) , each nest group sends sync packets to make sure music has no latency. when a user has multiple groups configured 'airtime fairness' blocks those sync packets.

Symptoms are that sometimes you can see some groups but not all. And playing to those groups will fail after a time.

Airtime fairness is enabled by default in Asus firmwares &gt; 384

Solution to the problem :
For each band (2,4ghz/5ghz/5ghz2) airtime fairnest must be set to 'disabled' afterwards the user needs to reboot all the accesspoints and nodes. It will take 5 minutes before all the groups are restored on the network. Some users also need to restart their phone(to close the google home app) to see the groups after this configuration change.

Can you please document this bug and see what can be done about it?

Some users also report that disabling roaming assistant also helps avoiding other group problems, but I suspect that a nest audio device should never be roamed, since they are attached to a wallplug...it would only cause instability during streams. Maybe you should disable roaming for nest devices (because even their doorbells, smoke detectors, nothing will be roaming)",2021-02-03 18:16:06,1,"Google nest groups unstable wifi solution (disable airtime fairness as workarround ) | Guys,

googlehome,Wetscherpants,Pulling my hair out running two Google Home Max Speakers as a pair,"Long story short I have two home max speakers on a sideboard in my living room. They are paired to each other for stereo sound and I stream music via Spotify.

Every day, multiple times per day, the music stops (whether it’s while I’m playing via Spotify or via Tunein radio)  and the voice assistant tells me something went wrong and to please try again. 

-Trying again doesn’t work

- Soft reset through google home app doesn’t work

The only fix is to physically unplug the speaker and plug it back in or sometimes I have to do a factory reset and then re-pair the speakers.

The funny thing is if i change the output device to say my phone or say the the google nest hub the music plays right away.

googlehome,regal_beagl,Google home won’t change my lights to orange?,"Howdy y’all. 

Okay so just bought some Magic Home light strips and connected them to my Google Home Mini.

Giving google the command to change the color of the lights works great EXCEPT when I’m trying to change them to orange.

No matter what variation of orange I say (dark, pumpkin, etc.) I get yellow. 
The lights are definitely capable of turning orange as the color is on the remote and in the app, which I’ve used before. 

Anyone else have this issue? Thanks!",2021-02-02 05:46:33,1,"Google home won’t change my lights to orange? | Howdy y’all.

Picking up where you left off in (fill in the blank podcast)"" and then playing the episode we listened to back in mid-December.... of any podcast or any the album of any artist played around that same time.  I can even ask it to stop after starting the ""most recent episode"" only to ask it to resume five minutes later when, you guessed it, it resumes the episode from December. It is infuriating! The Google Support wizards suggested I ""power wash"" the devices by plugging and unplugging the magical 10 times with 10 seconds between each plug and unplug, but that did nothing at all. I also deleted the app from my phone and wife's phone, did factory resets of all the devices, and reset my wifi. I literally cannot think of any other solution.

googlehome,Mr5atchm0,"Is there any way how to get temperature and humidity readings from a ""compatible"" sensor?","Here is the thing. I bought a 3in1 Smart Alarm/Thermometer/HumiditySensor which works fine in TuyaSmart/Smartlife apps (right image).

But when I load it up in Google Home App it recognizes it as a sensor with no advanced options, no visual data or voice responds from the assistant regarding this device (as shown in left and middle image).

Only thing I can is to ask Assistant to turn it on/off and it turns on/off just the sound alarm (and I can't even do this in the Home App interface).

Is there a way how to set it up to be visual, like a thermostat or just to ask the assistant for freaking room temperature at least. She always says I don't have thermostat set up yet. (Or maybe some kind of virtual thermometer device? IDK.) I can't change the type of the device in any of these apps.

Thanks for any advice.

googlehome,idontknow4073,"💬 adamant - an extension through a magical keyword spoken after Google's trigger word (""ok Google"") offering unlimited functionality.","Hello Reddit! 👋

Recently, I've been developing an app called **Adamant**, designed for the Google Home series of smart speakers. It's under development right now and will be for another few weeks or so until I can open-source it for the public.

This app will allow for 💬 **custom commands** to be installed in the form of modules. Each module is a 📄 **single file**, intended to be downloaded from GitHub repositories.

**Billing does not need to be enabled in Google Cloud Console!**

They are super flexible to the developer, granting access to:

* **custom triggers**
* **custom actions**
* **custom responses** (audio ***or*** TTS), and can even
* **push audio** to the speaker (eg. notifications)!

⭐ **This means voice-controlled playback of music from Youtube will be available as a module, for free!** 🎉  
Youtube Music Premium, Spotify Premium, and Spotify's infamous self-advertisements will become things of the past.

This sounds great. However, there's a catch 😭: Until I find out how to control the smart speaker outside of the LAN, you need to have an Android phone or Linux machine (eg. Raspberry Pi) on the network to act as a server for the speaker.  
Once I find out, I can offer the app as a service!

⭐ If anyone knows something about remotely controlling Chromecasts, please leave a comment or contact me!

Also, this project is starting to take up a lot of my limited time, and I don't even know if it will be useful for anyone.

⭐ Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

googlehome,droydmaester,gSuite calendar - ask your administrator for permission,"I've done a fair bit of research on this subject, but can't find an answer to this specific question.

I primarily use my gSuite email/domain which I set up years ago when you could have up to \~N users free. I have a personal gmail account, but it's mostly for spam, and I only check it a couple times a year. I know I could go back and share the calendars, etc., but I don't want to.

My home mini had said for a while ""I can't access your gsuite calendar yet..."" but about a week or two ago, I thought I'd try it again since it told me it learned how to do some new stuff.

So now when I ask it details of my calendar, it says, ""in order to do that, you'll have to ask your gsuite administrator for permission."" This implies there might be hope for a setting to turn this on, but I'm not sure where that would be. I am the administrator, and looked around the admin console, but not sure where that would be.

It’s sitting under Local Devices now. I can change its volume from Google Home so the device seems to be recognised by the app. But that’s it. I can’t add it to a room and home.

When I try to update the device settings I get an error message “unable to update device settings”. 

This issue started around when I added rear speakers (model SPK8) so I tried without them but still no luck.

- resetting the soundbar 
- reinstalling Google Home app
- reinstalling LG wifi speaker app
- resetting wifi router 
- changing time zone within LG wifi app

googlehome,PristDean,Stop Command &amp; Continual Running,"I've had these issues for nearly a year, Google has done nothing. It was left with 'The Google Engineers' apparently. I have heard nothing

So still... the issue I have is... If I use Home Hub Max to 'Show doorbell' (Google Nest Hello), it shows me the camera on the door. Then if I issue 'Stop'... it will do one of two things.... either stop my TV playing (because I started my TV from that device earlier, with 'Turn the telly on')... or stop playing music on a speaker in another room... but still shows the front door on the display.

Also, I have noticed if I start my TV (Chromecast Android TV) from the Home Hub Max with ""Turn the Telly on"", then if I issue the command ""Turn the volume down"" 30 minutes later. The Hub will respond with ""Use the remote control' So it's trying to turn the TV volume down.
If I say 'Stop' the TV stops playing. So in effect, whenever I start with 'Turn On' for a device, the Home Hub holds it in the background and any subsequent command is executed against that device... such as Stop or Volume up. Unless..... it's a Google Nest Doorbell it appears, then it ignores it

The above are really frustrating issues. All it needs is for Google to accept and execute a command on and against the receiving device. 

Doesn't seem that hard to achieve to me... but Google are taking an awfully long time to fix this.... which may be a show stopper for this 'Eco system' for me.

googlehome,die247,Be honest with me here: how many of you with multiple speakers in a home mostly use them to annoy eachother or make jokes?,"We have 4 google mini speakers in our house, 3 are in bedrooms while the 4th is in the kitchen.

Now, outside of playing a radio station or music, the most common thing we do with the speakers is annoy eachother with them, or find numerous ways to mess around.

I'm curious how many of you also have to deal with being rick rolled on a regular basis, or have some random routine played through your speaker?

It's to the point where I've had to set mine to quiet time between 11pm and 6am to stop anyone sending stuff (this was because of a particularly annoying time when someone cast music to it at 2am in the morning...)

Anyway, I'm curious to know what your experiences are, but, here are the main ways we've found to annoy eachother or play pranks:

1. Probably the easiest and most common; play music from eachothers speakers.
2. Broadcasts: Broadcast yourself saying something stupid or annoying is also common one.
3. Custom routines: Here is where it gets fun. A few of us have figured out how to make custom routines. Some of the ones I've made is one that reads the entire darth plagueis copypasta and ""shrek mode"" where it turns volume to max, says ""get out of my swamp"" and then plays All star... Others have come up with ideas as well: such as one where it says ""cyka blyat, cheeki breeki"" (Russian swearword, and gibberish) and then plays Russian hardbase, a similar one which plays the soviet national anthem at max volume and a much less creative one, where they figured out how to get around the swear filter and make the ""say"" routine command say various offensive words...
4. Change eachothers names: Since we are a family, some of our voices are similar enough that voice match confuses us for eachother. Because of this as far as google knows I'm called ""Penis Minimus"", while another member of the house us called ""Biggest dickus""... there are other name changes of variable offensiveness as well...

googlehome,spideyy1,Is google home multithreaded?," 

Hi,

I have a routine which ""talk to mister home"" for 30 minutes, and then turn on my electronic switch, i've used ""mister home"" method because i couldn't find any other way to set up a 30 minutes timer to turn on my machine - let's call that routine 'X' just for the example.

I also want to create a routine that does multiple stuff and among others calls the 'X' routine.

My question is, if i'd run let's say command A --&gt; B --&gt; X --&gt; C --&gt;D,

Would google run a, then b, then X, but won't wait the 30 minutes and move on to command C and D immediately (run in multithread - 2 threads), or would it get ""stuck"" for 30 minutes with Command X (no multithreaded)?

If it will get stuck, is there a way to ""hack"" this so it won't get stuck for 30 minutes?

Or, is there a better way to set up a timer for flipping a switch on for my electronic device?",2021-01-30 17:46:06,1,"Is google home multithreaded? |

googlehome,cdegallo,Nest Hub Max photo frame from google photos and data usage--a bit of insight.,"I previously set the nest hub max to show photos from my Google Photos library.  Screen timeout is set at 5 minutes, and it's also set to turn the display off when there is low light.

I've been looking a bit closer at our home internet data usage, and I noticed that the nest hub max was using something like 1.5GB of data per day on days when we weren't using it to stream any video or music.  I would estimate that there is MAYBE an hour a day when we are actively in the presence of the display.  Had set the photo to transition every 10 seconds.  I would also estimate that a photo on average is around 4-10mb per image, maybe less but probably not more.  

6 images per minute for 60 minutes is 360 images, that's around 1.4GB at the low end, which jives with the data usage I logged.

I didn't really realize how much data the photo frame was using.  We aren't hitting a bandwidth limit currently, but noticing that it's streaming 45gb of data a month was a bit startling.  I've turned off photo frame and data usage dropped to essentially zero unless we are streaming video or music.

(Still waiting on an answer) Can't seem to find a solution. Oddly enough I can tell GA to play netflix on this TV and she understands perfectly. This is only an issue with getting said TV to turn off or on. If anyone has any ideas, I greatly appreciate it..Thanks.",google assistant default to a now deleted device when i ask her to control tv |,16
googlehome,zacgarbos,Is my smart home just janky?,"So I've been having a bunch of issues with with my c by ge bulbs, if I set them up through GEs app they just straight up stop working, so I have to connect them directly to my Google home app, but every so often the network will hiccup and I'll have to reset them.

For example my good morning routine turns on my desk light, bed light, and my light switch for the overhead lights, give me the weather calendar and play music. But what it will actually is say ""one or more of your devices are not available, please try setting them up again. Sorry, something went wrong for desk light.

googlehome,i_am_abby,"Routine to trigger Sleep Jar or constant audio loop (no skips btwn repeats) on a separate, muted device","Hi Reddit, hoping someone can help out with a problem I have not been able to solve for months.

I have a Bedtime routine which does everything I need it to do for the evening, ending with playing sleep sounds. I use the Sleep Jar assistant app to play brown noise (I'm pretty particular about the sound, and Google doesn't have the sound I want built in to it's library) as part of my bedtime routine.

I have both a Hub and a (muted) Mini in my bedroom but find the Mini has better audio quality than the Hub, so I'd prefer for the noise to play on it even if I'm giving the command to the Hub.

Things I've Tried:

* Trying to target Sleep Jar commands to the muted speaker.
   * I have not figured out how to do this. ""Ask sleep jar to play brown noise on my \[Mini\]"" does not work.
* Setting Mini as default music speaker for the Hub
   * This doesn't work since Sleep Jar is not considered music, which lead me to...
* Creating a playlist with a track I found on YTM and telling the routine to play it on repeat
   * Will play on Mini, as intended, but will not repeat the track. 
      * ""Play my deep sleep playlist on repeat"" consistently errors out with ""Sorry something went wrong. When you're ready, give it another try,"" even if I ask it to repeat as a second command.
   * The audio skips frequently between repeats with this solution since the clip is only 1 minute long, and that will absolutely keep me up at night. Haha.
* Set up a timed routine to have the command triggered on the Mini at a certain time with another routine
   * \[When the time is X, this routine will ""ask sleep jar to play brown noise""\] / hear assistant audio on Mini
   * Not ideal since it's time based and not when  I say ""goodnight"", but this doesn't seem to trigger and I've read this feature is unreliable.

Does anyone have any tips on trying to achieve what I'm trying to achieve? At the moment I toggle mute on both speakers every night, activate Sleep Jar on the Mini and then run my bedtime routine from my Hub. This has been a long frustrating process with each of my ""clever"" ideas failing.

googlehome,IXI_Fans,My new Nest Mini is stepping on the toes of other Home Minis.,"I have a small home with an open floor plan and for about a year now I have had 5 Home Minis scattered around my living room/dining room/kitchen areas.  While sitting near the middle, all 5 Minis can hear my voice clearly and 9/10 times the *one* to respond is the one nearest to me, as intended. So far so good!
 
However, I recently added a Nest Mini to the mix.  Now when I say something like 'set an alarm for 10 minutes', the nearest one replies as usual, but now the Nest Mini does as well simultaneously, so now I have to alarms set on two devices.  Or worse, I ask about the weather and while giving the same pertinent information, they phrase things differently *at the same time*. 

The Nest Mini does not seem to be communicating to the others in the same way as all the Home Minis have before (basically saying *""no one else reply, I got this""*).  This isn't a 'room' or 'group' issue, I have tried moving/adding it to others and making it's own. I also deleted and reset twice.  Is this happening to anyone else? I searched a bit and didn't see anything like my problem.

googlehome,mlz-,Chromecast activation remotely with different Google Account,"Last night I had an extremely weird issue happen with Google Home / Chromecast, that creeped me out a lot. I woke up in the middle of the night to noise, which turned out be Chromecast playing an YT video on the TV. Later today I chatted about it with my partner, who's visiting his home currently. He told me that his nephew had asked Google Home to play that video at their home and complained that the playback didn't work (since it happened couple thousand kms away).

Now what makes this quite odd is that:

* My Nest Hub + Chromecast are linked to my G Suite account and thus I haven't even set up any home sharing.
* My partner uses his own regular Google account. He also uses iPhone, so no Google assistant on the phone.
* The Google Home and Chromecast with Google TV at his home are set up under another, totally separate Google account.

Has anyone else had anything similar happen? For the time being I decided to unplug my Chromecast, I don't want another another wake-up like that.",2021-01-25 15:34:14,1,"Chromecast activation remotely with different Google Account | Last night I had an extremely weird issue happen with Google Home / Chromecast, that creeped me out a lot.

googlehome,gibbons_,Cannot precisely control volume level on Samsung Soundbar connected to Samsung Q80T TV / Google Home.,"Hi all - I have a strangely specific issue that is difficult to even explain. I searched but found nothing. Please help!

**The set-up**: I have a Samsung Soundbar (HW-J355) connected via Optical cable directly to my Samsung Q80T TV. There is no issue between the Soundbar and the TV. The TV correctly identifies audio output to Optical, and when I press volume up/down on the stock remote, it correctly adjusts the Soundbar volume as expected.

For example -- if volume is set to ""20"", pressing volume down on the remote has the TV display an ""Optical"" connection pop-up (this will be important next) with no indication of volume number. The Soundbar display, however, correctly adjusts from ""20"" to ""19"" and the volume decreases as expected.

**The problem**: Google Home has successfully linked to my TV. The problem occurs with volume commands. If I say, ""Okay Google, lower TV volume"", the TV will display the same ""Optical"" connection pop-up, but then nothing happens. The Soundbar display does not indicate a command and does not lower volume, despite the TV understanding that some type of command was given to the Soundbar. And because the TV displayed this pop-up, I'm assuming Google Home gave the TV *some* type of command... But clearly there is no follow-through to the physical Soundbar.

**Question:** What do I need to do to get Google Home to correctly adjust the volume of my Samsung Soundbar when it is connected via Optical into the TV?

googlehome,slash-drumbler,A couple of syncing issues,"I have a fair few Google devices (Minis/Audios) etc. Lately I've noticed if I'm streaming a podcast from my phone to a Nest speaker and ask the Assistant to transfer audio to another speaker (from kitchen speaker to bedroom speaker for example) it will do so but also disconnect my phone and simultaneously continue to play the podcast on both the requested device as well as my phone and slightly out of sync.

Spoke with Google support who didn't seem to know the issue and suggested I used the command ""sync all of my devices"".

googlehome,Vinylcrackhead,HiFi integration,"So I've got a good few Google devices throughout the house. The only pain in my main room. I'm quite into hifi equipment and have a relatively nice hifi there.

My way of working it just now is my TV goes into the hifi and I run from my chromecast. There are however two major problems with this. 

a) my receiver interprets all signals from the TV as surround and doesn't do anything fancy like auto switching to stereo

b) (and the one that annoys me the most) I like multi room audio. The rest of my Google products do this *flawlessly*. Chromecast is abysmal at it. It's always at least 90ms out of step and the most annoying thing is I have to reset it every time I play it. I think chromecast is so bad because I think it uses the chime when the speaker is enabled to sync with other speakers. As chromecast has no mic it's flying blind. I *think* that's the issue but wouldn't really know! 

So I looked at some of the raspberry pi setups out there and it seems they can all do the question and answer thing but don't register in Google home as a speaker.

Has anyone attempted this successfully?

My best world is if there was a way to have a Google home type device that would output a digital signal to my hifi unit (so I can use my decent DAC). 

The raspberry pi part of that is easy (pi + hifiberry digi hat) but I've no idea if it's worth going down the rabbit hole.",2021-01-24 18:16:10,1,"HiFi integration | So I've got a good few Google devices throughout the house.

googlehome,billkaboo,Can't switch WiFis,"Need help switching google homes to a new WiFi - any ideas?

I recently added a Google/nest mesh network to my home setup. But I still have the original router because it's a modem and router in 1, and I can't plug the external network feed directly into my nest WiFi (wrong cable). 

So I have both networks running. 1 from my original router, and 1 from nest WiFi. 

My Google homes around the house are connected to the original network and for the life of me I can't figure out how to switch them to the new network. I've looked online and it says go into settings, select WiFi, and tell it to forget network. That option simply doesn't exist. 

It existed for my Chromecast so I switched that over (with some finagling) but its not an option for any of my Google homes. 

Would really appreciate any tips you might have.

googlehome,A13XCAM0,Google Nest Wifi Speed Cap?,"About a week ago, I purchased a 2pc nest wifi mesh system to replace our OnHub, as we have Gigabit Fiber internet, but we were only able to get 200/100 speeds out of it.

When I received the nest wifi system, I noticed it a SERIOUS pain to install and set up. Abnormally so. I'm pretty experienced in setting up routers in the past, I know it should be as easy as a couple of wires, a QR code, and you're good to go, but it wasn't. 

Every time I tried to run initial setup on the main router, it would error out. Once it just flat timed out, and twice it said it couldn't get signal from the modem. Eventually, after over an hour trying to run the initial setup through the app, it finally succeeded. Only problem was, our speeds were a consistent 50/10, on every device, in every area of the house. It literally looked capped, the speedtest would just stop right there near 50 every time for upload, and then around 10 for download.

My question is: Can this router really only handle 50/10 speeds? I just find it hard to believe that in 2021, there is still a 300$ router that caps at 50/10 speeds. I really feel like something went wrong here, but I just can't figure out the problem. Did I get a defective unit? Is there a compatibility issue with the modem or fiber internet?

My question is: Can this router really only handle 50/10 speeds? I just find it hard to believe that in 2021, there is still a 300$ router that caps at 50/10 speeds. I really feel like something went wrong here, but I just can't figure out the problem. Did I get a defective unit? Is there a compatibility issue with the modem or fiber internet? Help would be appreciated.

Sorry for the long post.",google nest wifi speed cap | about a week ago i purchased a 2pc nest wifi mesh system to replace our onhub a we have gigabit fiber internet but we were only able to get 200 100 speed out of it when i received the nest wifi system i noticed it a serious pain to install and set up abnormally so im pretty experienced in setting up router in the past i know it should be a easy a a couple of wire a qr code and youre good to go but it wasnt every time i tried to run initial setup on the main router it would error out once it just flat timed out and twice it said it couldnt get signal from the modem eventually after over an hour trying to run the initial setup through the app it finally succeeded only problem wa our speed were a consistent 50 10 on every device in every area of the house it literally looked capped the speedtest would just stop right there near 50 every time for upload and then around 10 for download my question is can this router really only handle 50 10 speed i just find it hard to believe that in 2021 there is still a 300 router that cap at 50 10 speed i really feel like something went wrong here but i just cant figure out the problem did i get a defective unit is there a compatibility issue with the modem or fiber internet help would be appreciated sorry for the long post,262

googlehome,Hero_Of_Shadows,Should I be able to make mobile calls with Nest Home Mini and my Android phone ?,"So my setup is:

* android phone with google home application installed, the phone can make calls as normal
* google nest mini, on the same wireless network as my phone 

Can I set up things so that I verbally say to the mini ""Ok Google call &lt;Contact name&gt;"" and it makes a mobile call (not a duo or another type of call through the internet) with my phone but it uses the mini's speaker and microphone ?

I've managed to get it to make duo calls but:

*  my mother and grandmother don't like duo that much they'd rather our short calls be normal phone calls
* my girlfriend I just don't understand the internet in her house is horrible again she'd rather us have normal phone calls more often.

The nest mini seems to have a really good speaker and most importantly microphone so that's why I'm hoping it can be used.

The wifi at my place is good, the mini and the phone recognize each other, my location is in Europe.

So, I have a Nest router, one point and one Google WiFi way off down the end of the garden for internet in the garage.

My Nest hello is dropping out every couple of hours and has been for months! The Hello has already been replaced for a new one, so it's not the device itself. 

So a few issues. the Hello will decide that the best mesh point to connect to it the one in the garage, not the main router a few feet from it. And even then, when I can force it to connect to the router, it still drops out! 

Yesterday I decide to try an old tplink power line I had laying about with a WiFi extender on the other end and it hasn't dropped out once! Not once!

This can't be a permanent solution right? Surely Nest WiFi and Nest Hello should work together? Is there a setting I'm missing?

googlehome,ConversationNo5729,"Logic behind preventing scheduled actions for heaters, but allowing to switch them on/off","So I've got a smart socket with an electrical heater set up in a room, since we don't have central heating in this house at the moment.  
Wondering if scheduled actions for devices not setup as lights, I tried asking the Assistant to turn the heater on for 30 minutes.  
The answer I received was: ""due to safety reasons, I can't set up scheduled actions for devices such as heaters"".  
Fair enough, I get the reasoning behind automatically switching on heaters unsupervised. But I'm wondering what the logic is behind preventing me asking the assistant to only switch it on for a certain amount of time, but allowing me to remotely turn them on anyway?

As im walking the ""distance"" I would like to say something along the lines of ""OK Google continue the music in the hallways as well"". Then when im in the stairs ""OK Google join in on the rest of the music""... I arrive at the bathroom, sit down and say ""OK Google play the music in here as well"".

I've read about ""transfer music"" commands, but similar to most of the comments I can barely get it to work. + I would like the music to continue playing in the area im leaving. Essentially fill the entire house with music. 

I have a total of 12 speakers in the house and I have them grouped as living room, downstairs, upstairs and whole house.

googlehome,zellisATX,Undercabinet Lighting Wish List...Does the Perfect Solution Exist?,"I'm renovating and need to choose the correct undercabinet lighting. All lighting will be hardwired/ direct wired and each zone (noted in different colors) will have separate wall switches operating independent of each other. I'd also like the ability to control the various zones with my phone. Below is my wish list. Does anyone know if there's a lighting solution that has most or all features? I'm open to all feedback. Thanks. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Hardwired fixtures
* Slim or flat design
* Dimmable
* Color temperature control (warm/ cool/ daylight/ etc.) - Not too concerned with colors beyond white but not against it either. 
* Wall switch compatible
* Smart enabled (phone app, voice, etc.)
* All 4 areas can be controlled independently, grouped together as one, or a combination of zones
* Works with Google and Apple
* Remembers settings - I've read some have issues with lights resetting to factory or max brightness after being turned off. 

It seems like there are a few ways to approach this given different wireless technologies and smart switches but I struggle finding the correct physical fixture (or light strip with diffuser panel/ housing) and then deciding on the best way to wirelessly control. \*\*\*I'd be totally content with non-smart wall control so long as I could manage all of the features from my phone. The ability to flip the switch on the wall (for my entire family) and have them work without opening an app or using voice commands is important. 

Are strips better than fixtures? Are diffusers generally preferred? 

I'm certain I don't want the uneven light disbursement of pucks. 

I'm open to a system requiring a hub but not really interested in a hub that only controls those lights (i.e. Feit Electric). If going the hub route, I'd like it to control ceiling fans (not yet sure if the fans will have lights built in). 

Its maybe worth noting that the lighting under the kitchen island is not a priority and I haven't thought that all of the way through. Just thought it would be a cool effect.

googlehome,AmericanAssKicker,Routines randomly changing and not working in the past week or so. Ideas? Anyone else?,"We run these EXACTLY the same way every time; via audio commands that run the routine, e.g. ""Goodnight"" or ""Good morning""... Simple. 

In Example 1, nothing in this system has changed in months, possibly even a year. Same nightly routine, too.

Both of these started having hiccups the past couple of weeks. Everything was working smoothly for upwards of five months (ex.1) but now it's all sorts of frustration. 

**Example 1**: simple routine goes like this: Routines start, ""Goodnight AmericanAssKicker"", Lights to X setting, tells me my schedule for tomorrow. Then when it goes to turn device volume to X% and play spotify (device being google home) it asks what device, or that it can't, or changes the volume on another device entirely. 

**Example 2 (Google TV):** ""Good morning AmericanAssKicker"", lights change to x setting, tells me the forecast, but when it goes to play news channel on GoogleTV/YouTubeTV, it then asks which device I want to do this on and then tells me to get the remote... 


Few other notes: There are other googles in the home but none of them are picking these up, as noted by the proper use of my name and telling of schedule and forecast on the correct device.

googlehome,mrhomiec,[Q] YouTube Music Playing Same Handful of Songs From Playlist,"i noticed this last night. i have a routine that does the following

""shuffle X playlist from YouTube Music""

this playlist has 449 unique songs in it. after about 5-10 songs, i hear the same song again. then after 5-10 songs i notice that same song.

so i tried to pay attention and i realized it's not just the one song playing again. it's the same group of songs shuffling itself.

for example, if i hear songs in a 1-2-3-4-5 order. then it can play in a 3-2-1-5-4. then in a 1-4-2-3-5.

i'm not sure how long it's been like this, only realized it last night.

on a related thing, this has happened ever since i had to move from Google Play Music to YouTube Music back in October. but the first song that plays is always one of the first 5 songs in the playlist.

after the first song plays, then it seems like the rest is truly shuffled... until last night.

I want the speaker to play rain or relaxation sounds

I want the nest hub to play Meditation music on spotify 

Routines doesn’t seem to want to let both play on different speakers

And the bonus one is I want to get my google tv to run a photo album I have saved of meditation images(right now it will only play two images and then gives up streaming them). 

Any tips to get this working?

I have tried to do some automations with IFTTT but I can only duplicate the new iCloud events to the Google ones, but if I change some thing in a event, the Google calendar does not changes, because the trigger is only for new events.

googlehome,hywelinesh,Google home consistently cuts me off,"Hello there,

For the past few months now, my google homes have been cutting me off mid sentence. A few examples:

* ""Hey Google, turn the lights off"" *Sure, turning on the lights* (checking my activity, Google heard ""turn the lights"").
* ""Hey Google, play music"" *Sure, playing the playlist called this is Muse* (this could be the most infuriating of them all because I hate Muse).

I've tried speaking quicker and putting particular emphasis on the final part of the sentence but I'm quickly sounding like an absolute goon and a lot of the time it doesn't work.

I've also tried changing the sentence up: ""No lights"" for instance, but then it hears either ""no thanks"", or ""no lies"".

It seems like it may be related to it being in night mode (i.e. room dark), as if I try to reproduce when the hub is awake, it works fine.  It looks like I can reproduce this during the day by making the room dark, then letting the alarm kick off. Curious if anyone else has seen this?",home hub medium daily alarm clearing after a few second if display is in night mode | been trying to figure this out for awhile whenever i set a daily medium alarm source youtube music i see the alarm start then after 3 4 second of playing the music the alarm just stop by itself the alarm is supposed to go off at 7 15am daily and it outside my downtime period set up from 10pm to 6am it seems like it may be related to it being in night mode i e room dark a if i try to reproduce when the hub is awake it work fine it look like i can reproduce this during the day by making the room dark then letting the alarm kick off curious if anyone else ha seen this,137

googlehome,marcusdiddle,Horrible first experience with Chromecast w/Google TV,"Received a new Chromecast w/Google TV for Christmas and just set it up today. Wanted to watch the United/Liverpool game which was only available on Peacock, and my Samsung Frame TV doesn't have a Peacock app. So, away we went to set up the Chromecast.

Right away, wasn't able to sign into my Google account while initially setting it up. Just kept failing to sign in. Based on some searches, it seems others have had the same issue. So I had to skip that part and manually sign into my Google account using the remote (painfully entering in a 16-char password with the on-screen keyboard).

Once I finally had it set up and all the apps installed, first thing I noticed was the UI was significantly slower/laggier than that of even my native Samsung Smart TV UI. Menus were slow to load and clunky to navigate.

Once I was able to get Peacock app installed and activated, I had a horrible experience trying to watch anything on Peacock. Not sure if this is down to the app, or the hardware itself. But I was only able to watch 10-15 min at a time before I'd get a ""No internet connection"" notification from the Chromecast. Toggling wifi off/on would cause it to reconnect, but at that time, Peacock was completely locked up, so I had to reboot the Chromecast itself. This happened 5-6 times during the course of viewing a single game. Once I finally got the stream going again, it was stuck at 360p quality for 1-2 minutes before HD finally kicked in. But even when HD finally kicked in, motion blur was terrible...much worse than when viewing on YouTube TV using the native Samsung app.

My Google Wifi access point is literally right next to the Chromecast (less than a foot). The Chromecast network status shows signal strength as ""Excellent"". In the year I've been streaming TV on my Samsung itself, have had no issues. I had high hopes for the Chromecast and expected the experience to be vastly superior than the native Samsung UI, but it was the complete opposite. Ready to just box it up and return it.

googlehome,Fatal_Neurology,GH controlled S/PDIF fiber optic switcher?,"I have a living room sound system made up of two JBL CF120 speaker cabinets driven by an Onkyo TX-R602 amp (remote is long lost), with the amp receiving S/PDIF fiber optic lines from both my PC and my TV. Normal tech from the previous decade. If I'm listening to music, my amp is on the PC input. If I'm playing on my xbox, my amp is on the TV input. My gripe is that if I'm switching back and forth between video games and chores (kinda like an interval workout), I CONSTANTLY need to walk over to the amp and switch the inputs. 

I've previously investigated if there was a mixer that could combine the two fiber optic signals into a single fiber optic signal that would let me enjoy video game sounds and my music at the same time. This isn't really possible (there's no hardware that does this, and even if you hacked together some hardware that did, decoding and recoding the digital signal would introduce latency), and the best alternative was a small switcher box with a handheld remote I could use to switch from one source to another without touching the amp. 

Wasn't really interested in having a remote at the time, but now I want to know if there's a way I can have google home control my speaker source. This would involve a smart controlled S/PDIF fiber optic switcher box that would switch the single output signal between various input signals based on verbal commands to GH, or a smart audio amp with built-in GH compatibility for switching between inputs. Barring any better options and betraying my desperation on this, I have honestly envisioned a GH controlled servo that physically presses the different input buttons on the amp or a switcher box.

This would involve a smart controlled S/PDIF fiber optic switcher box that would switch the single output signal between various input signals based on verbal commands to GH, or a smart audio amp with built-in GH compatibility for switching between inputs. Barring any better options and betraying my desperation on this, I have honestly envisioned a GH controlled servo that physically presses the different input buttons on the amp or a switcher box.

googlehome,rhammond84,Speaker groups with Chromecast audio sometimes not responding to Assistant,"Odd problem: some speaker groups will stop responding to request to play music via Assistant (phone, or Google/Nest device). Device indicates request received but nothing plays, no cast stream live in the Google Home app. Also cannot initiate music from the 'Play Music' shortcut for the group in the Google Home app.  Casting directly to the group from e.g. YouTube Music works fine. 

Think have narrowed down to following:
- Only seems to impact groups that have Chromecast audios in
- Rebooting the Chromecast audio from the Google Home app menu temporarily resolves the issue
- Issue reappears later, potentially after something has been casted to the Chromecast audio in the meantime (and maybe also only if the cast stream is left 'open' but not playing). 
- Casting by any means to the affected chromecast audio individually works by any means throughout all above. Even other speaker groups that include the affected chromecast audio work.

* Can I assume equivalent functionality irrespective of whether a family member uses Android / Google contacts or iPhone / Apple phone book?  If not what are the limitations?
* How does a NHM decide who is talking?  I assume that this is the done by matching against the voice models of the members of the Home where the NHM is registered.  Is that correct or is it more specific to individual devices?
* How do spoken names get mapped to identities (*e.g.* nick names, contact s / phone book, etc)?

googlehome,MetalDetectorists,I cannot for the life of me get Google Home to tell me what time is 8 hours' away.,"I don't set my alarm with Google Home every night. On the nights that I do, I'll say ""set an alarm for 8 hours"" and it will set the correct alarm.

However, I cannot get it to work out what time is 8 hours plus now. If at 10pm, I say ""set alarm for 8 hours"" it'll say ""ok, your alarm is set for 6 am"". If I say ""what time is it in 8 hours?"", it replies ""sorry, I didn't understand"".

I've tried:
""8 hours + 10pm""
""2200 hours + 8 hours""
""6 am - 8 hours"" (as a test; this also failed)


Nothing works. I get weird results too, like
"" 2200 hour + 8 hours"" sometimes results in the answer ""16"". Sometimes ""what time is it in 8 hours time?"" is answered with ""there are X amount of seconds"". My favourite is when I asked ""what is 8 hours away?"" and it gave me the address of a gym located about 35 mins away.


On my phone, ""what time 8 hours from now?"" shows a webpage from Time Calculator, but Google mini will respond with ""I don't understand"".

googlehome,Nickfab,Google Nest Mini or...?,"Hi, I already have 2 Amazon Echos at my house and I wanted to try something new, so I started looking at the Google Nest Mini and I find it pretty interesting.
I want to get a 3rd assistant just for my room (amazon echos are in the living room and kitchen) but I'm kind of sick of Alexa, especially when listening to music or asking ""internet questions"". The problem is that Alexa's internet integration kind of sucks, it's not as good as Google's (for obvious reasons) and it often (like, REALLY OFTEN) misunderstands the title of many  songs, so I end up stressed and giving up.
At this point I thought a Google Nest would solve my problems because it has a much better internet integration; but while looking on reddit I noticed some people complaining about how excessively talkative it is and how voice recognition is kinda meh...is that really the case?
I wouldn't really worry about voice recognition because I'm Italian and my language is less ambiguous than English (from a phonetic point of view, so the assistant shouldn't have that many problems recognising words), + it should recognise english songs' titles much better.
But is that ""being too talkative"" thing really a problem? I even read of people whose commands were ignored and google just replied with a curiosity. I use the Italian version of Google Assistant daily on my.phone and I never noticed that, is google assistant (on an Adroid phone) different from Google Nest's assistant?

googlehome,thebartyparty234,Google nest multi-device configuration,"I've got a nest mini 2nd gen. They're going for cheap right now and I was wondering about buying a second one for two reasons:

1. Improved audio
2. I've got a raised bed and would like a nest mini next to me to play alarms, sleep sounds, morning news etc.

Can anyone give me any advice on the configurations for dual speaker groups in google home? I've done some digging and it looks like I'll either be able to set them as a speaker group or as a stereo pair.

However, here lies the issue... I still want to be able to use each speaker independently (one on my desk for when I'm sat at it, one on my bedside for waking up/going to sleep). Can anyone that's familiar with this answer the following questions?

If I set them up as a stereo pair can I use the google assistant on both speakers independently?

Is there even much of a noticeable difference in quality/loudness between stereo pair mode and grouped mode for nest minis? Bearing in mind there isn't really a clear L/R separation, they're both kinda above each other

googlehome,ThatsFarOutMan,Google Home Max as a sound bar - volume controls,"Hello.

Couldn’t find any info on FAQs.

I have a google tv plugged into an older tv. At the moment I have the audio output to a sony entertainment system. The google TV device uses a matched frequency from the remote control to control the volume on the Sony system I believe. It all works quite well. But the Sony system is starting to die. I also have an older google home standard next to it.

I would like to minimise the space by replacing it all with a google home max. I can run RCA cables from the tv to an adapter for the 3.5mm audio jack with no problems. My concern is whether the google th remote will be able to control the volume.

My guess is that the remote will control the volume on the built in TV speaker and I’ll need to use voice commands or the google home app to control the Max’s volume. Which would be a pain.

Does anyone know of any solutions. The TV also has optical audio out which can be converted to 3.5mm jack as well but I suspect this would have the same issue?

Another option would be to get a sound bar with HDMI ports but that’s roughly twice the price and isn’t the look I’m going for.

I feel many of us - especially those who use GH a LOT for smart home control haven't realized how many work arounds we've come up with?  I just realized it and I've so many I can't even keep count! 

Here's a decent example where I've had to implement a few work arounds over time.  

To stream my Nest Hello (named FRONT DOOR) doorbell video on my big TV.  I used to have a routine where I said ""view front door"".  Routine would use Harmony Hub to switch TV input to Chromecast.  Then issue command ""stream front door on Chromecast"".  Then mute the TV (wind noise is annoying).  All was well!  Then Google started to SHOW the control page for my Nest Hello doorbell on my Harmony Hub when I said ""View Front Door"".  Uugh.  Ok. So I renamed routine  ""View Front *Porch*"".  Hey! I'm back in business! Then a while later when I ran the routine - my Google Hub would just sit on a blank, black screen after I issues the command. Huh? Per Google this was ""expected behavior""?  Why Google?  WHY?  
So I had to add "" what time is it"" as the last line in the routine.  Everything still works and streams fine - and by the routine asking ""what time is it"" at the end my Home Hub doesn't sit there with a blank screen.  It tells/shows the time then goes back to the regular screensaver (a clock). 

I have many, many more.  This has been the most in depth to date.

I received my Nest Audio free with my new Pixel phone the other day. On the day that I received it, my partner came home at 2pm and put the Xbox on. He was playing online for a couple of hours with no issues. 
At about 8pm, he came in and told me that ""something"" was using an the bandwidth. He unplugged the Nest Audio, came back and told me that it was much better. It's been unplugged ever since.

We've got games consoles, 3 phones connected to the wi-fi. We stream all our music and TV. I've never once found one particular device that slows the internet down so badly that he can't play his game. 

Is it possible that it was due to the device being new? It might have been downloading something? I can't find a way to view what bandwidth each device is using, even in the router settings.

googlehome,SatchBoogie1,Home Mini has issues with casting,"I have one Home Mini device from 2017. Over the last couple of days I started having an issue with casting Spotify to the speaker.
 
* Before, I was able to open the Spotify app, start a playlist, open up the ""cast"" part, and select my speaker. Connected with no issues. Now, when I open Spotify, I get to all the steps, but my speaker no longer shows. 
* My current remedy is that I have to open the Home app and select my speaker. Some reason it now prompts me by saying it's ""connecting..."" and I have never had that dialog with the device before. Usually when I am within the home or in the same room it just auto connects. I then try to click ""play music"" under the speaker icon in the Home app main menu page. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't. I sometimes tap the Media button and try to select ""play music"" with the Spotify icon on the left and then ""listen on"" the speaker. Again, sometimes it works and then it doesn't. 

At the start of the new year, I did install a new router. I initially had issues re-connecting the Mini to my network, but I got that fixed after a factory reset. No issues to note for the first seven to ten days. This issue I am asking about just started on Monday. 

My router has 2.4 / 5Ghz bands split. The mini is connected to the 2.4Ghz network. My phone is also on the same network. The mini is one room away from the router so signal should not be an issue.

I've already tried unplugging the mini and plugging it back in. 

I tried unlinking and relinking my Spotify account. I also force stopped the app. 

I'm using a Pixel 3 (with the latest January update) to cast and control my Mini. I don't think the January update is the culprit because I had downloaded that already before this issue started happening. I shut down my phone, changed networks, etc with no change.

But if I open Google Home, I can click on the speaker pair, then ""cast my audio"" to it.

Anyone had this issue ? Any tips ?

Thanks",2021-01-13 04:36:13,1,"""Cast to"" not showing devices. But devices visible in Google Home, and I can ""cast my audio"" ... Help? | Hi all,

googlehome,Bajeebo,"Problems with the ""Additional Language"" feature of the Google Nest Mini (Gen 2)","Hello! 

I got a google home as a present just a few days ago and managed to set it up properly. I was able to set its primary language to ""English (United States)"" and its additional language to ""日本語（日本) / Japanese) because I'm currently studying the language.

For a couple of days, it ran smoothly; I was able to use Japanese prompts to activate google home's Japanese assistant, request Japanese songs to play on Spotify, etc. Of course, I was also able to use the English prompts as per usual.

Sadly, starting yesterday, my google home mini can't recognize my Japanese inputs. When I prompt it using the Japanese prompt, it activates but will use the English assistant. This is problematic because the English assistant tends to butcher the Japanese inputs and then it starts to do extremely different stuff from what I've actually requested. Most of the time, it just says that it didn't understand the request at all.

I've already tried the following: (1) Resetting my google home device, (2) Uninstalling and resetting my google home and assistant apps, (3) Turning everything on and off again, (4) Switching gmails, and lastly, (5) contacting google home support. Sadly none of the above worked.

I have also tried converting the main language to Japanese, but then everything turns into Japanese and I'm not at that level of understanding the language yet.

TL;DR = New to google home. I'd like for my google nest to be primarily in English, but with an auxiliary Japanese setting for when I actually need it to be Japanese. But my google nest persists to stay in English.

I've scoured the internet for solutions and found that the issue has been stated by some, even here on Reddit, for a few years now, but no solution has been posted yet.

Hoping someone can help!",2021-01-13 03:04:39,1,"Problems with the ""Additional Language"" feature of the Google Nest Mini (Gen 2) | Hello!

I've rebooted my router and all devices, I even unlinked a few devices and rediscovered them and the Google devices all say instantly ""hmmm something went won't, please try again in a few seconds"" and my phone says ""Can't reach Google at the moment"". Is there anything I can do on my end? I had my router dns set to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 (Google's DNS) and reverted back to my ISP DNS and still nothing. This also is happening on mobile data so I have to believe it's an issue with the service. Is anyone else experiencing this issue? If so, have you found a fix? My whole home is set up as a smarthome and now I can't use anything by voice.

Any help would be appreciated.

googlehome,djasinsk,Help with C by GE lights and wireless light switch,"I have had 4 C by GE bulbs for a couple years now and despite some interruptions they have been pretty solid.  I had them set up through the google home app and was able to control them with my voice, my google hub, and lenovo smart alarm clock.  Today I bought a wireless light switch thinking I would be able to add that into the equation and control one room with that switch.

However, when I went into the google home app to set up the switch I realized it wasnt possible, so I went into the C by GE app to set it up there.  It wouldn't let me set it up without a light also set up in the app so I did that as well, removing it from the google home app.  After getting the firmware updated I was able to get the switch working with the light.

The problem is now that light is no longer in the google home app and I can't link the google home and C by GE app.  When I follow the steps to link them it seems to kind of crash and not really link despite flashing at the bottom that it is linked.

googlehome,autom8r,"Potential breakthrough for ""Ok Google"" not responding leading to shouting!","Dear GH'ers, 
If you're like me you've been wondering why the hell Google hasn't fixed mic sensitivity in regards to our Google Homes' responding to their wake words! It seems ridiculous that Google can't fix this, however, with some hindsight now I believe I know why...

I had a bit of a Eureka moment when I visited my parent's house 2 months ago. My Dad was throwing around Google Home commands left, right and centre and to my surprise he always got an accurate response! My Dad hates technology and doesn't speak very clearly or very slowly, he just expects it to answer him and it does!

This got me thinking, ""what's different about their environment that's significantly different than mine..?"". The only glaring difference I could find was that my parents use fibre Internet 150/150 where I was stuck on cable internet with 300/15. Their download speeds are lower, but sufficient, however their upload speed is 10x mine. I began to wonder if the lower latency on fibre, or the vastly superior upload speed, was causing Google Home to respond to the wake words more quickly and accurately.

Turn the page to five days ago. Fibre Internet was finally installed in my location and I subscribed to 1gbps/1gbps.   Given the findings at my parent's house I opted to try whispering to my Google Homes around my house to see if I could get them to wake to the quietest of commands and... THEY ALL WORKED! Only 1 command did not register and this was because I was literally trying to see how quiet I could be.

Five days have now gone by and several hundred commands have been logged. Typically we'd be repeating every 7th-10th command, but to date, only 1 single command has failed when it should have worked!

I don't fully understand what is occurring yet, but it's starting to make logical sense why Google hasn't fixed this: the issue isn't them, it's our Internet. 

So why would upload speeds or latency matter? I'm still trying to figure out how this logically works, it's the last place I would have looked, but it's the only logical difference between my environment and my parent's AND my testing appears to confirm this hypothesis. At least anecdotally. 

Anyone else noticed this?

TL;DR If you're struggling with Google not waking, try swapping your Internet connection if you can to a connection with better upload speeds and lower latency. An idea is to try a 5G hotspot from your phone if it has low latency (&lt; 10ms).",2021-01-12 01:19:14,1,"Potential breakthrough for ""Ok Google"" not responding leading to shouting! | Dear GH'ers,

Recently I’ve been wanting to start investing in growing my smart home and I’ve been swaying back and forth between the Google and Apple ecosystems. I use many Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch), but I also have a couple of Nest Mini’s that I got from Spotify and a few Chromecasts. 

I’ve recently been more intrigued by the Google route, obviously it’s more reasonably priced than Apple and there are more options. Any other Apple Users decide on a Google home?

Right now I’m thinking of picking up one or two Nest Audios to add to my house, through research I think the sound quality is good enough, and it would be nice to be able to stereo pair them together and have the ability of multi-room audio with my Nest Minis.

I've recently bought a cohort of Google Nest devices to begin building my smart home!  
I've created a speaker group with my Audio, Mini (2nd Gen) and Hub Max. When I try to play music on the group, 2x of the devices play the music. The 3rd does not. This unlucky 3rd devices changes if I recreate the group. They're all well within Wifi distance.  


When I open the Home app  and click on ""Media"" I see all 3 devices listed. I have 2x of the devices selected, the 3rd is deselected. If I go to also play on that 3rd device it attempts until eventually saying ""something went wrong"".  When I try to remove and add devices it \_seems\_ that I can set up the ""audio"" devices together but with the ""hub"" device they struggle to play nicely together.

I guess I could upload a video screengrab of it if that would help -- but was wondering if anyone else encountered this and had any ideas of a fix? -- Might just have to factory reset and start from scratch.

When I open the Home app  and click on ""Media"" I see all 3 devices listed. I have 2x of the devices selected, the 3rd is deselected. If I go to also play on that 3rd device it attempts until eventually saying ""something went wrong"".  When I try to remove and add devices it \_seems\_ that I can set up the ""audio"" devices together but with the ""hub"" device they struggle to play nicely together.

I guess I could upload a video screengrab of it if that would help -- but was wondering if anyone else encountered this and had any ideas of a fix? -- Might just have to factory reset and start from scratch.
